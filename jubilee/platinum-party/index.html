          girls in your unit or make new friends with girls in your division or district!</p>
        <p>Dressed up in your finest royal outfit, you could dance the night away to some Platinum rated hits or play
          some fun games like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Musical thrones (royal take on musical chairs)</li>
          <li>The Queen Says (Simon says but make it regal)</li>

        <p>Every good party has music so why not have a go at making your own, whether by yourself or in a group,
          practise humming, singing, on a musical instrument or even try signing it.</p>
        <p>To conduct your own unique performance, try out making your own instruments and play them along to a
          well-known tune like &lsquo;God Save The Queen&rsquo;:</p>
