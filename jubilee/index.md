We have put together this pack to help us celebrate Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth IIâ€™s 70 years on the throne. The themes are based around the events that the Queen will be taking part in over the Jubilee weekend.

Short activities have been designed for families to be able to do as well as units, giving complete flexibility. There is no rule as to what needs to be done or how many activities. The pure aim is for our members and their families to have fun, get involved and celebrate this joyous and historic event.

We would love to see what you have been up to so please do share with us using the methods explained throughout the pack. Following our Design a Badge competition, [badges are now available to order.][1]{:.external-link}

Thanks to the team of volunteers who have helped to create the pack.

County Commissioner
