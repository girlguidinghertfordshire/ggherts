I have had such a fabulous experience of Guiding from the minute I started as a seven year old Brownie. As a Guide I took full advantage of the amazing number of opportunities made available to me including Introduction to the Hills, a unit trip to Switzerland and represented county or country at three international camps. After gaining my Baden Powell Award, I went on, as a young adult to complete my Queenâ€™s Guide Award, learning many valuable skills along the way.

Now as the leader for the same Guide unit I attended, I really love seeing how Guiding continues to make a difference to young girls. The Guiding family is such a strong bond which I love to be part of.

During the first year as County Commissioner I was pleased to meet with so many of our members and build a strong team with the rest of the County Team. Together we have achieved so many great things already, despite the challenges 2020 has brought us. The passion and dedication that our volunteers have shown during the year has made me even more determined to continue with our goals of making their experience even more rewarding. We will continue to work together to improve communication and processes and hope that we will be able to come together in person again as soon as possible.
