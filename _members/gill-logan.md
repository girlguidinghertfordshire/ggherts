I started guiding in 1955 on the Isle of Anglesey in a completely Welsh unit - the only English resource was an Our Chalet song book. In 1962 I became Unit Guider of 1st Amlwch Brownies, and in 1975 Unit Guider of 6th Welwyn Garden City Brownies.
    
I have also been Division Pack Holiday Adviser, team leader for Heronswood District, Safeguarding Adviser, and Assistant Leader with the 6th Welwyn Garden City Guides with special and complex needs.

As County Special Needs Adviser my role involves:

- Supporting and offering advice to Leaders who have girls with special and complex needs in their units.
- Supporting girls in their units who have special and complex needs.
- Visiting units to give advice.
- Organising and supporting Happy Hearts - social and residential events for girls in the County who for various reasons are unable to go away on residential events with their units.
- Supporting the Anglia Team on their organised events for SMILE which holds social and residential events for girls with special needsÂ in Anglia.
