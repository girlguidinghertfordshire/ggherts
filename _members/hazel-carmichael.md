I loved Brownies when I was a young girl growing up in Dublin, and never wanted to leave! I have so many happy memories of wonderful crafts, games, songs, pack holidays and special friendships. I was honoured to be chosen to take part in the Rally to celebrate Irish Girl Guides’ Diamond Jubilee in 1971. Moving on to Guides brought new adventures and more freedom. I especially loved our summer camps and cooking over an open fire.

I re-joined guiding when my middle daughter wanted to start Rainbows, and the new unit in Rickmansworth needed adult helpers. That was nearly 20 years ago!

I later moved with my daughters to Brownies. It wasn’t long until I went into uniform… and I still love being part of the leadership team. I started writing articles about our Brownie unit for the local paper and was soon asked to take on PR for South West Herts Division. For the past 5 years I have been working to raise the profile of Girlguiding and aiming to attract new leaders - by writing articles for local papers, magazines and church newsletters, posting on local community Facebook groups and sending numerous photos and stories to SHARE.

I took on the role of county comms and PR adviser in February 2020, and we just managed a first team meeting before going into lockdown. I have been posting daily on the Girlguiding Hertfordshire Facebook page since, as a means to engage with and provide support and activities for leaders and parents. Our PR team is growing, and we are planning how to reach a wider audience.

If we can help or advise you with promoting an event/ new venture, give advice on branding for a badge or promotional material, assist with reporting on an event to raise awareness of guiding, or by sharing stories to celebrate your guiding adventures - please get in touch via <a href="mailto:pr@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk">pr@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk</a>.
