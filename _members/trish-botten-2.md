I was a Brownie, Guide and Young Leader in Essex South East when growing up. I moved to Middlesex NW where I did my ALQ and ran Brownies, and then to Bedfordshire.

Since moving to Hertfordshire in 1995 I have lived in Hemel Hempstead with my ever expanding family. I ran Brownies until 2005 but remained in the District as a District Contact. I have also been involved in the training team, as administrator, for many years. I was lucky enough to experience what guiding offers by walking the Great Wall of China in 2007 on a fundraising project. I am just about to finish 5 years as Division Commissioner for West Herts, which has been an exciting and fun time.
