Trefoil Guild is “Guiding for Adults” and open to both men and women over the age of 18 who agree to support the guiding ethos - including the pledge to help other people. There are currently 21 Guilds in the county which meet on a regular basis, usually once a month. They are autonomous, and each has a wide programme of activities which loosely fit around the headings Get Active, Give Support, Get Involved, and Find Friendship. Events are also arranged at County, Region and National level. Part of my role is to represent Hertfordshire Trefoil on the Girlguiding Hertfordshire executive committee and on the Anglia Trefoil executive committee.
