I have such fond memories of being a Brownie and a Guide as a child and my love of Guiding has been reignited after becoming a unit volunteer when my daughter joined Brownies.Â  I love helping the younger girls, especially with arts and crafts, and love how enthusiastic they all get with their creations.

Working as County Administrator for Girlguiding Hertfordshire is, however, very different to the world of Financial Services and Banking that I previously worked in but I am looking forward to a new and rewarding chapter and utilising my skills to aid and support the county team.
