I first joined Girlguiding as a Brownie, moving on to Guides and Rangers. I had a break until re-joining as a Unit Helper, just over 17 years ago, when my daughter started Brownies. I went on to train as a Leader and took over the unit when Brown Owl left. Since then I have been a District Commissioner and currently hold District Administrator, Assistant Division Commissioner, County Archivist and County Membership Systems Coordinator roles. Somehow I’ve never developed the art of saying ‘no’. I do admit that County Archivist was a job I volunteered for without having to be asked! I have always been interested in Girlguiding history and have a small collection of my own. I find it fascinating!

As County Archivist I am responsible for looking after all the items in the archive, collecting old and new items to add and putting on displays at County events . It’s a huge learning curve as this covers uniform, printed books, magazines, log books etc. All need the correct methods of storage and protection. The current aim is to catalogue and digitise as much as we can whilst taking care of those items that need particular care.
