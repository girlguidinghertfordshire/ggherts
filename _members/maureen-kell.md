I started my guiding career in County Durham in 1953 as a Guide in 1st Sedgefield Guides. After leaving university I was a Guide and Brownie Leader in Sedgefield and District Commissioner in the Teesside District. We then moved to Leyburn in North Yorkshire where I started a Guide Unit in Lower Wensleydale as well as running the 1st Leyburn Brownies. There I gained my Camp Licence. My first son was born in Northallerton and was with me at the age of 18 months when I was assessed for my licence up in the dales. Camping at this time was tents pitched in a farmer’s field, electric fence around to keep out the cattle, lats with hessian screening dug by the hedge and water carried from the farm in milk churns. Much more fun than nowadays on sites with running water and showers!

Returning to Durham County I ran a Brownie Pack and Guide Company for 10 years in Darlington. At that time I also served two terms as DC in Darlington West District. In Cockerton I opened a Ranger Unit which is still going.

Coming south to Hitchin in 1982 I intended to leaving Guiding behind for a while, but 3 months later I found myself Leader of St. Ippolyts Brownies. As DC for Hitchin East I ran several different units at various times to rescue them from closure. I re-opened Hicca Rangers and was with them for 10 glorious years (my favourite time in Guiding). I gained my Pack Holiday Licence, my Senior Section Camp Licence and my Large Scale Licence.

After moving to Letchworth I was DC for Letchworth North District and then Letchworth District after the two Districts merged. Altogether I have been a District Commissioner for a total of 22 years!

I have been North Division Commissioner, Senior Section Adviser and Queen’s Guide Adviser for Hertfordshire and I am presently Leadership Qualification Co-ordinator.
