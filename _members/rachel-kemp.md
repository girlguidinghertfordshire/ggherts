Working as County Administrator for Girlguiding Hertfordshire is
    a world away from my previous job as a Legal Secretary. The role is certainly
    varied and challenging and I am excited to be part of an organisation that empowers
    and inspires girls and offers them a such a great variety of opportunities and
    experiences.
