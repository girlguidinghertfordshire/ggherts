I was a Brownie and Guide, but unfortunately there was not a Ranger unit for me to attend so I left the movement. I returned after having three daughters of my own. Like many others I became a leader because help was needed at the local Rainbow unit where my girls wanted to attend. Although my children have all grown up now I am still enjoying Guiding -  I run a few units, I have supported at a number of camps, and activity days, as well as assisting the Division. I gained my International licence a number of years ago when I lead a County trip to Sangam, I am looking forward to my next adventure with the International team.
