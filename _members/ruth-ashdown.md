I became involved in Hertfordshire guiding in 1980 when I stepped in to keep a Guide unit in Stotfold from closing.

I have held the position of district and division commissioner for North, and am now on my second term as assistant county commissioner, where my main responsibility is looking after new district commissioner appointments and other administrative tasks.
