As a child I was a Brownie and a Guide, but when we moved house aged 12 I left Guiding. I returned to the fold when my daughter was a Rainbow in 2010 and started to help at her unit, before progressing to Brownies. The couple who ran the unit, 1st Thorley Brownies, were moving away and they asked me to stay on and run the unit, which I did. I still run the unit, with another leader and we have a lot of fun with our Brownies. I became the district commissioner for Bishop's Stortford West in April 2019, then when we merged with Bishop's Stortford East, I became the district commissioner for Bishop's Stortford, which is a huge challenge, but one which I am very much enjoying.

I have been a Police Officer since 2002 and have worked in a number of front line roles. I currently manage Victim Services for Hertfordshire Police and work closely with my colleagues in the Safeguarding Units. I am also married to a police officer and my husband is currently a Detective in Hertfordshire.

Outside of Guiding and Policing I am a keen Rugby player and play for Bishops Stortford Ladies team as well as coaching the U18s girlsâ€™ team. I am incredibly passionate about empowering young women to help them achieve anything they set their minds to.
