I was a Brownie and a Guide as a child growing up in South Africa. We moved to the UK when I was 15 and eventually got back involved when I was at University in Nottingham, helping with a guide unit there. When I moved to St Albans in 2003, I started helping at a guide unit and a few years later when my Division Commissioner at the time encouraged me, I agreed to open my own guide unit. A few years later, I also opened a rainbow unit we run on a Saturday morning, which is now five years old, as there is such demand for places for that age group locally. I love the many exciting and varied opportunities we are able to offer to the girls and see how they develop throughout their time in Girlguiding. I have a fantastic unit team and my fellow leaders are now some of my best friends.

I have also had roles as both District and Division Commissioner in St Albans. I have really enjoyed these leadership roles and it is great to be able to offer other Leaders the support that I have always had from my own Commissioners.

I joined the County Finance Committee as part of my role as Division Commissioner representing the Trustees, so when Sue asked if I would take on the County Treasurer role when Maureen retired, I was delighted to accept.
