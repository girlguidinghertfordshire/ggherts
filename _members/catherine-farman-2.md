I grew up into a Guiding family and having participated as a Brownie, Guide and young leader in Watford.Â  I went directly into leading a Guide unit at the earliest opportunity. 30 years later, I am still running a Guide unit but have added Rangers and Rainbows to this also. I enjoy mentoring new leaders in all these sections and encouraging others to get the most out of their Guiding opportunities. Over the years I have held region, county and division roles including public relations, international, camp &amp; outdoor and division and district commissioner as well as grass root Guiding.

This new role in county serves to try to use all this experience in supporting as many young women as possible to explore all the options and opportunities that Guiding offers, locally, in county and further afield.
