Our county Inspire team is growing to support the 18-30 network in Hertfordshire.

This newly created role would suit an enthusiastic, well organised individual who would play a key part in supporting the Inspire team.  Help shape how volunteers within the county can become more connected and involved.

Dealing predominantly with administrative tasks, you would also have the opportunity to be involved in creating exciting events and activities for the Inspire audience.  Creative skills would be beneficial to help build the Inspire Hertfordshire brand.
