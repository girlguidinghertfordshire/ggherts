Inspire is Girlguiding's offering for all 18-30 year olds. It doesn’t matter what your everyday role or level of interaction with Girlguiding is, all members within this age range are automatically part of Inspire. It is a place where you can make new friends, learn new skills and take advantage of the many awards and opportunities on offer.

This exciting opportunity has arisen to help jointly lead our county Inspire team, empowering and supporting our young women within this demographic.

Do you have what it takes to lead in a partnership, shaping and growing the Inspire community within Hertfordshire county?
