Awards are a wonderful way to celebrate the achievements of members and recognise our volunteers. As a county we understand the importance of ensuring our volunteers feel valued and appreciated.

We are looking for our next county awards lead volunteer to head the awards committee.

Could you be the driving force we need to identify volunteers who have gone above and beyond and deserve recognition?

Help promote all aspects of awards and plan the annual county celebration event.
