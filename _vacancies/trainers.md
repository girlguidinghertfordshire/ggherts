We want to ensure that we can offer regular, high quality training opportunities to all our adult members in the county and region.

Girlguiding Hertfordshire is therefore looking for new trainers to join the Anglia training team.

Visit the [‘becoming a trainer’](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/learning-and-development/helping-others-to-learn/becoming-a-trainer/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} section of the Girlguiding website to find out more about what is involved.

Be that role model for other volunteers and help ensure excellence and consistency across our organisation.

Complete the application form and email it to Anglia region via <angliahq@girlguiding-anglia.org.uk> to apply.
