This exciting new county role has been created to help reduce our environmental impact and work to make all properties within Girlguiding Hertfordshire more sustainable and environmentally friendly (with a special focus on the county centre).

You should be passionate about the environment and be able to think analytically and critically in order to suggest ways to reduce our environmental impact and create a strategic plan.  Previous experience in a similar role and knowledge of environmental law would be beneficial but is not essential.

You can find out more about what the role entails below and apply via <vacancies@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>.
