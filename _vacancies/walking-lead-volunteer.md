We are very fortunate to have an active and successful county walking team who organise social walks and weekends away, help our leaders run unit events, and assist those working towards their Girlguiding walking scheme qualifications, to name just a few.

We are looking for a new county walking lead volunteer.  Do you have a passion for adventurous walking and walking related activities and feel you could inspire and lead the county walking team?

You can find out more about what the role entails below and apply via <cc@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>.
