We are looking for 2 enthusiastic volunteers who hold their going away with qualification, including the relevant camping module (module 8) if appropriate, to become our county residential lead volunteers in a shared role. Working closely together, ideally 1 lead volunteer will focus on indoors residentials, and the other on camping but exactly how the workload is split can be decided between the 2 volunteers appointed.

As county residential lead volunteers you will lead, support and advise volunteers working with those interested in completing their going away with qualification so they can offer girls exciting residential opportunities.

You will also support leaders in facilitating the camp permit and Lead Away permit and provide opportunities for girls to obtain their qualifications.

You can find out more about what the role entails below and apply via <vacancies@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>.
