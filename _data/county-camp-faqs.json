    "question": "Why Sunday - Friday?",
    "answer": "In order to avoid late arrivals and early departures and a limited uptake due to family holidays, we decided to run the event for young members from Sunday - Friday. Leaders may arrive on Saturday 25 July to set up their campsite and enjoy an afternoon of activities and BBQ themselves."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is catering provided?",
    "answer": "With the exception of Brownies staying indoors (or in Roy&rsquo;s Reservation tipis) and the Ranger and young leader subcamp, catering is the responsibility of unit leaders."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I have an online food order delivered to site?",
    "answer": "Yes. Online food orders can be made during the week to assist with safe storage of food. However, you must specify your site location on your order to minimise confusion when it arrives."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the cost of travel included?",
    "answer": "Travel is not included in the ticket cost. We encourage car sharing where possible to reduce the volume of traffic and the number of cars left on site. For those wishing to park during the event, you will be issued with a parking permit to display on your dashboard.\n\nPlease note that transport grants may be available from county or region to assist with group travel to PACCAR."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I order my t-shirts and badges?",
    "answer": "Merchandise e.g. t-shirts, neckerchiefs and badges, will be available to pre order from **2 March 2026** and will be available to collect upon arrival. While 1 t-shirt is included in the price, additional items can be ordered for an additional cost."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there an onsite shop?",
    "answer": "PACCAR does have an onsite shop selling badges, souvenirs, sweets and drinks. Girls may bring spending money with them but this is at the discretion of the unit leaders."
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is responsible for first aid at the event?",
    "answer": "Each leader, who is attending with their girls, is responsible for the first aid of their unit. There will be additional leaders in the core event team that can help with first aid if required."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I have to have my going away with qualification to bring my girls?",
    "answer": "As you are responsible for the administration of your unit attending and the first aid cover for your girls, it is advisable that a leader holds their going away with qualification. However, the qualification is not essential for Brownie leaders who are staying in indoor accommodation. This will be covered by the event leaders if required.\n\nIf you do not have your going away with qualification, please contact <countycamp@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> to discuss ways in which we can help you and your girls attend."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I be assessed for my going away with qualification at this event?",
    "answer": "Unfortunately not. However, the [county residential team](mailto:residential@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk) would be happy to provide assistance towards an assessment before this event."
  },
  {
    "question": "I have a member of my unit with a disability. What adjustments can be made so they are able to attend?",
    "answer": "We are committed to making reasonable adjustments to ensure that all young and adult members can attend county camp if they wish to do so. Due to the nature of the site - 60 acres of woodland and open fields - it is important to note that some pathways are uneven and some places more accessible than others.\nIn order to cater for specific and often unique circumstances, please could leaders contact <countycamp@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> so that we can work to make this camp inclusive for all."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a limit to how many Brownies I can bring?",
    "answer": "At present, for leaders looking to sleep indoors with their Brownies, there is a limit of 6 spaces per unit. A leader must attend with those girls to maintain the ratio of 1:6. If you would like to be considered for additional Brownie spaces, please note this on your booking form."
  },
  {
    "question": "I don&rsquo;t want to be restricted on numbers; can Brownies camp?",
    "answer": "Absolutely! Brownies can camp either as a unit; alongside a “sister” Guide unit, or part of a district or division. The leader in charge of that group should have their module 8 of the going away with scheme. It is not essential for the leader to have the appropriate programme module (module 6) as we are providing the activities.\n\nLeaders must cater for Brownies who are camping, and they will need to provide the camping equipment e.g. tents."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there an indoor accommodation option for Guides?",
    "answer": "There is no indoor accommodation option for Guides. Guides attending county camp will sleep in tents with their unit, within a district or division or as part of our Guide subcamp."
  },
  {
    "question": "Leaders aren&rsquo;t available for this due to work commitments. Can Guides attend without their leaders?",
    "answer": "There will be a Guide subcamp for those who cannot attend with their leaders. Spaces are limited."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do Rangers and young leaders need to camp with an adult?",
    "answer": "Rangers and young leaders are able to attend county camp without an adult leader. If they have their Lead Away permit, they can run their own camp. If not, the Ranger subcamp will be overseen by a member of the county team."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will leaders be required to help on activities?",
    "answer": "Many activities will be run by onsite instructors, but some will need leader instruction - for example - Rabbit Run. We will endeavour to keep leaders with their girls when leader instructed activities are allocated.\n\nIf you would be interested in running a craft activity, or have a qualification and would like to instruct something specific during county camp, please contact <countycamp@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>."
  },
  {
    "question": "In order to bring my unit, I will need to bring my own children to camp too. Is that a problem?",
    "answer": "Leaders&rsquo; children are welcome at county camp; however, Girlguiding ratios must be adhered to.\n\nParental consent forms and health information forms must be obtained for each child and hold emergency contact numbers for people who are not attending camp.\n\nPlease be aware that there is limited capacity indoors for additional children and adults outside of the 1:6 ratio for attending Brownies.\n\nThe cost for leaders&rsquo; children will depend on their age and accommodation option. Please contact <countycamp@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> for further details."
