        girl who did not complete and who it is subsequently awarded to, so that county records can be kept up to date!

        opportunity for their name (first name only) to be published in the county&lsquo;s Share magazine. Names
        aren&lsquo;t automatically added following a badge order being placed as it can take time before they are
        awarded and we don&lsquo;t want to publish names before this has happened. There are also some awards that do
        not get completed and are subsequently awarded to someone else. Therefore, once you have awarded a Gold, please
        advise the Badge Secretary so their name can be included in the following edition of Share.</div>
