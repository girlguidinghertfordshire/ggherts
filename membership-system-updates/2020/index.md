<strong>Safe Space</strong>
Please make the time to complete you’re a Safe Space trainings appropriate to your role. Membership <strong>will</strong> be withdrawn for those who are non-compliant on 1st January and they will not be able to return until January 2024. If there are mitigating circumstances these <strong>may</strong> be taken into account but please inform county before the deadline.

<strong>Safe Space - Recording of Safe Space E-learning</strong>
If you have completed an e-learning but it is not recorded on GO, a screenshot or photo of your screen, showing the completed training with the date should be sent to <a href="mailto:leadership@girlguiding.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leadership@girlguiding.org.uk</a>. Please make sure to include the date you completed the training and your membership number.

<strong>Changes coming into force on 1st January 2021</strong>

All volunteers must have the appropriate levels of A Safe Space training for their role. New volunteers will have to complete Level 1 before they’re made active. If they then need additional levels they will have 120 days to complete these. The 120 days also applies to renewals and existing volunteers changing roles.
There must be at least one active leader in each unit who has Level 3. All unit meetings and activities must have a leader present who has an up to date A Safe Space Level 3 under the compliance system, so you may need more than one leader to complete it to cover absence. Longer term, it is envisaged that every leader will need to complete Level 3 as part of the Leadership qualification.

Going Away With License Holders must have A Safe Space Levels 1, 2 and 3 when they go on a trip. All other attendees in a leadership role must have at least Levels 1 and 2.

All 1st Response trainings will be full 6 hour courses. Refresher courses will no longer be offered or accepted. There will be a new syllabus and an e-learning that must be completed, further information can be found on the <a href="https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/learning-and-development/first-aid-training/1st-response-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Girlguiding UK website</a>
<h4>November 2020</h4>
<strong>Safe Space</strong>
Please make every effort to ensure that all required Safe Space training(s) are completed by the <strong>31st December deadline</strong>. We do not want to lose you! If trainings are not completed by the deadline, roles will be suspended and membership will be withdrawn. You will not be able to reapply to re-join for three years.

From 1st January all unit meetings must have someone with A Safe Space Level 3 present whether indoors, outdoors or virtual.

<strong>Safe Space - Recording of Safe Space E-learning</strong>
Before starting an e-learning please ensure that you have your membership number (or enquiry reference if still in the enquiry process) and the email address that is recorded for you on GO. For the training to be recorded you <strong>must</strong> have an email address on GO which <strong>must</strong> be unique and not shared with anyone else on GO.

Only one of either membership number or enquiry reference needs to be entered, the other should be left blank.

If you do not have your membership number and/or have forgotten the email address that you have used for GO please ask your commissioner to look them up for you <strong>before</strong> you start the e-learning. If you no longer have access to the email that is registered on GO please contact your commissioner and ask her to alter this for you. <strong>Commissioners</strong> - If the volunteer’s email address is associated with an activated login, only HQ will be able to alter it, please contact them on <a href="mailto:membershipsystems@girlguiding.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">membershipsystems@girlguiding.org.uk</a>.

If possible, save a copy of the final screen showing that you have completed the course, just in case it is not recorded. If you do encounter difficulties with the recording please contact me on the <a href="mailto:membership@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">membership@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk</a> email address with any proof that you have.

<strong>Safe Space – New Volunteers</strong>
New volunteers joining between 3 September and 31 December will receive an email asking them to complete the relevant levels of Safe Space required on the day their role is made Active.

New volunteers joining after 1 January 2021 will have to complete Level 1 <strong>before</strong> their role is made Active. If they then need other levels of A Safe Space they will receive an email asking them to do these after the role has been made Active. No volunteer will be able to join until they have done their Level 1.

<strong>1st Response Training</strong>
Please note that from 1st January all 1st Response trainings will be full 6 hour courses. Refresher courses will no longer be offered or accepted.

<strong>Bank Accounts – Update to Signatory Requirements</strong>
You need to have at least three signatories set up by 31 March 2021.
When choosing who will be your signatories, choose people you see regularly and can easily meet with. <strong>At least two signatories should be from your unit or level</strong>. The third signatory can be any other adult, but you could choose someone from the next level up.

Any adult can be a signatory but
• They cannot be related.
• They cannot be in a relationship with another signatory.
• A signatory cannot review the units accounts.
• As signatories are managing funds, they will need to be recorded as a recognised volunteer on GO and have a valid disclosure check.

Cheques and withdrawals must have two signatures or dual authorisation. It is best practice to make sure the signatories are not the people getting the payment. For example, if a leader is claiming expenses, the other 2 signatories should sign for this.

I would recommend that signatories who have no other role on GO are put on as Treasurer with the alternative title of Treasurer (Signatory). This role does not require membership, so no subs to pay if membership is set to Recognised Volunteer, but does allow for the required DBS. This role needs to be reviewed every 3 years so will also force a reminder to check that signatories are still willing and able to carry out that role.

<strong>Covid-19 Updates</strong>
Meeting both indoors and outdoors is now allowed but do keep up to date with government, National Youth Agency and local Covid-19 requirements as these can change rapidly. The latest full guidance from Girlguiding can be found on this web page: <a href="https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/coronavirus-keeping-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/coronavirus-keeping-safe/</a>

<strong>Indoor meetings</strong>: Yes
<strong>Outdoor meetings</strong>: Yes
<strong>Group size</strong>: Up to 15, plus leaders.
<strong>Consecutive meetings</strong>: Leaders can attend consecutive meetings in the same venue or location. Any indoor space must be thorough cleaned between meetings. If groups are meeting at the same time, in separate rooms or areas, then they can share a first aider.
<strong>Face coverings</strong>: You need to wear face coverings for indoor meetings. They are not needed outdoors. At indoor meetings face coverings should be worn by Guides, Rangers and volunteers. Rainbows and Brownies do not need to wear them. If someone cannot wear a face mask a visor or face shield can be worn but be aware that these do not offer as much protection as a mask. Any visor or shield must cover the nose and mouth. Medical grade PPE is not needed.
<strong>Social distancing requirement</strong>s: Where possible, stay 2 metres (3 steps) away from others, indoors and outdoors. Social distancing should be maintained during all activities
<strong>Toilets and hand washing</strong>: Everyone should wash their hands or use hand sanitiser when they arrive and before they leave. You do not need to have separate toilets for each group or bubble, but you should try to limit the number of people using them at the same time.
<strong>Shared spaces</strong>: Shared spaces such as sports halls or kitchens need to be deep cleaned thoroughly between meetings if different groups are using them on the same day. Spaces should not be used by more than one group at the same time. Shared spaces must be thoroughly cleaned when the unit meeting ends.

<strong>Meeting Places</strong>
It is now a legal requirement that all physical meeting places must display a QR code for users of the venue to scan using the NHS Covid-19 app.
Scan the code using a smart phone when you arrive at your meeting venue to log your visit on the app. Only those aged over 16 are able to scan in using the app, this includes leaders and volunteers, visitors and all young members over 16.  Parents don't need to scan the code when they're dropping girls off.

You must continue to ensure GO records are up to date for every meeting and keep a register of attendance.

If you own the meeting venue it is your responsibility to provide the QR code for your venue.

<strong>Safe Space</strong>
Safe Space reminders have started to be sent out from Girlguiding, trainings must be completed by the end of December deadline. If the Safe Space trainings required for your role(s) are not completed by 31st December, you may find your role suspended from 1st January 2021.

<strong>Safe Space</strong>

<strong>Long Service Awards due April and June 2020</strong>
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic we were not able to give out the April awards and the June/July awards are now due. It has been agreed that the 5,10 and 20 year awards will be posted out and I am working on these now, starting with those due in April.

<strong>New Girlguiding policies and First Aid Requirements</strong>
You may have noticed in the last Discover, Grow email from Girlguiding that they have launched two new policies: the health, safety and welfare policy and the digital safeguarding policy.  Please do make sure that you stay up to date on these policies by following the links in the Discover, grow email (10/6/2020)

In particular, please note that when face-to-face meetings resume there will be a requirement for first aid cover to be provided at all meetings. Further guidance is expected in the next ‘Making Guiding Happen’ email due in a few days.

<strong>Safe Space Requirements</strong>
A spreadsheet has been sent to all division commissioners with details of the Safe Space training needed by individuals. There has been no indication, so far, that the December deadline will be extended, so please encourage all volunteers to complete the trainings as soon as possible.

Levels 1 and 2 are both available as e-learnings.
Level 3 - A virtual training is in development and we should hopefully see an announcement soon.
Level 4 – This is being delivered as a virtual training via webinar. You need to have completed Levels 1 to 3 first and can book a place by emailing the Leadership and Development team at <a href="mailto:Leadership.EmailAccount@girlguiding.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leadership.EmailAccount@girlguiding.org.uk</a>

<strong>Coronavirus – DBS Checks</strong>
We are still not able to start any new DBS checks. This applies to new volunteers and current volunteers whose existing disclosure needs to be renewed. See the current <a href="https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/policies/girlguiding-policies/recruitment-and-vetting-policy/recruitment-procedures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guidance here</a>
<h4>April 2020</h4>
<strong>Coronavirus – DBS Checks</strong>
Do not start any new DBS checks. This applies to new volunteers and current volunteers whose existing disclosure needs to be renewed. See the current guidance here:<a href="https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/policies/girlguiding-policies/recruitment-and-vetting-policy/recruitment-procedures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/policies/girlguiding-policies/recruitment-and-vetting-policy/recruitment-procedures/</a>

<strong>Coronavirus - Virtual Meetings and the use of digital tools</strong>
Girlguiding advice, including the requirement for parental consent, can be found here:
<a href="https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/what-we-do/adventures-at-home/getting-started-with-online-guiding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/what-we-do/adventures-at-home/getting-started-with-online-guiding/</a>

<strong>Commissioners – GO Active-Pending roles</strong>
If you find yourself with a little spare time, please could you check for active-pending roles in your districts and divisions. These can most easily be found by sorting your Volunteer Roles table by Status Reason. The Active-Pending roles will come to the top of the table.

The most common reasons for roles to be Active Pending:

<strong>A young leader has turned 18</strong>. You should discuss a future role with them and with their unit leader. When this has been agreed you should deactivate the YL role and add an appropriate adult role, if they continue to volunteer.

<strong>DBS has expired</strong>. Leaders and commissioners should already be aware that this is needed, disclosure reminders are sent to both starting 4 months before the expiry date. A new request will show under the Disclosures tab. However in light of current advice these cannot be currently carried out.

<strong>Role has reached its max date.</strong> Many roles have a set time limit and can usually be extended by a set period. If a role has already been extended and the volunteer is to continue in the role then the role must be deactivated and a new one added. See the links to the role tables on the following page for role lengths and extension periods: <a href="https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/policies/girlguiding-policies/recruitment-and-vetting-policy/recruitment-procedures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/policies/girlguiding-policies/recruitment-and-vetting-policy/recruitment-procedures/</a>

<strong>Recording of Safe Space E-learning</strong>
Before starting an e-learning please ensure that you have your membership number (or enquiry reference if still in the enquiry process) and the email address that is recorded for you on GO. These must be entered at the end of the e-learning so that it can be recorded on your GO record. <strong>Please note</strong>, only one of either membership number or enquiry reference needs to be entered, the other should be left blank.

If you do not have your membership number and/or have forgotten the email address that you have used for GO please ask your Commissioner to look them up for you <strong>before you</strong> start the e-learning.

If possible, save a copy of the final screen showing that you have completed the course, just in case it is not recorded. In this event the confirmation can be forwarded to HQ to have it added to your record.
<h4>March 2020</h4>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Safe Space E-Learning on GO</span></strong>

Please ensure that you have your membership number (or enquiry reference if still in the enquiry process) and the email address that is recorded for you on GO when completing a safe space e-learnings. These must be entered at the end of the e-learning so that it can be recorded on your GO record.

If you do not have your membership number and/or have forgotten the email address that you have used for GO please ask your Commissioner to look them up for you before you start the e-learning.

<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>February 2020</strong></h4>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Subscriptions</strong></span>
Deadline <strong>7pm 24th February</strong>
Please check invoices very carefully. There were some initial errors which have now been corrected by HQ. Please don’t leave any role changes to the last minute as ending a main role may impact on another level. Do check your invoice just before the deadline to make sure that nothing has changed.

If you have any worries about whether you have sufficient funds to cover the invoice please speak to your commissioner.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Roles with optional membership</strong></span>
Subscriptions are paid for all girls and volunteers who have membership status equal to ‘Member’. Subscriptions are paid once only at the level where a volunteer’s main role is held. Subscriptions are not paid for volunteers who have membership status equal to ‘Recognised Volunteer’.

Some roles have mandatory membership, others have optional membership. Please check that the membership status for roles with optional membership is set as required. Any change to the membership status should be discussed with the volunteer. Details for each role type can be found on links to unit/district/division roles on the following page: <a href="https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/policies/girlguiding-policies/recruitment-and-vetting-policy/recruitment-procedures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/policies/girlguiding-policies/recruitment-and-vetting-policy/recruitment-procedures/</a>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ending the role of a Leader in Training or YL doing the LQ</strong></span>
If you end a leader in training role for any reason other than that the volunteer has completed their Leadership Qualification, please make sure that their mentor is told. Please also notify the county leadership qualification adviser and/or county membership systems coordinator so that the LQ and modules can be marked as postponed or abandoned. The system does not do this automatically, nor does it tell us they have gone.
<h4><strong>January 2020</strong></h4>
<strong><u>Subscriptions</u></strong>

<u>District/Division Levy - Deadline 17<sup>th</sup> January</u>

The deadline for the addition of district/division levies and bank details to GO is <strong>17<sup>th</sup> January 2020</strong>. It is imperative that you meet this deadline if you wish to add a levy to the 2020 subscriptions. If you miss this deadline you will not be able to update details and levies should not be collected in any other way.

<u>Other Key Dates</u>

<strong>Noon, 17 January: </strong>2020 levies and bank details for each district, division, county, country and region must be entered into the system.

<strong>Noon, 28 January: </strong>trial invoices are available to view and amend.

<strong>11 February: </strong>a reminder email sent from Girlguiding to the main contact of any level that has not yet viewed their trial invoice.

<strong>7pm, 24 February</strong>: no more changes can be made to trial invoices.

<strong>Noon, 25 February: </strong>official and payable final invoices will be available to download.

<strong>17 March: </strong>reminder email will be sent to the main contact of any level that hasn’t yet paid their official invoice.

<strong>Noon, 1 April</strong>: all subscription payments must be received in full by this date.

<u>Caution! Ending a role</u>

Please be aware that if you end the <strong>main</strong> role of a volunteer with ‘Member’ status and the volunteer has other roles, their main role will automatically be set to another role. This may not be in the same level and it would be courtesy, if possible, to warn the other level(s) (unit/district/division/county) that someone may appear on their Subscriptions Due report as a consequence of the change.

Last year we had a couple of instances where changes were made at the very last minute and when final invoices were published units had additions to their invoices that they were not expecting. This caused some confusion and distress and is a good reason to check your invoices early and to keep checking in case anything has changed.

<u>Member vs Recognised Volunteer</u>

Subscriptions are paid for all girls and volunteers who have membership status equal to ‘Member’. Subscriptions are paid once only at the level where their main role is held.

Subscriptions are not paid for volunteers who have membership status equal to ‘Recognised Volunteer’.

Some roles have mandatory membership, others have optional membership. Please check that the membership status for roles with optional membership is set as required. Any change to the membership status should be discussed with the volunteer.

Details for each role type can be found on links to unit/district/division roles on the following page: <a href="https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/policies/girlguiding-policies/recruitment-and-vetting-policy/recruitment-procedures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/policies/girlguiding-policies/recruitment-and-vetting-policy/recruitment-procedures/</a>
