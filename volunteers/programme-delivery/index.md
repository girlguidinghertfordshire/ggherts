Girlguiding aims to help girls develop the skills needed to achieve their dreams, and build their confidence through the activities and adventures they take part in as part of the programme.

To help our leaders and volunteers, Girlguiding have created frameworks and the following guidance for you to use when planning your programme.

## The Girlguiding programme 

The programme is the foundation of what girls do in guiding.  It challenges, empowers and inspires girls.

Full of variety, girls will develop new skills and experience exciting activities and adventures, earning badges along the way.

The activities in the programme are designed to support the [Five Essentials][1]{:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} as well as supporting girls to develop in line with the [educational framework.](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/information-for-volunteers/programme-and-activities/our-educational-framework/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}

## The Five Essentials

The [Five Essentials][1]{:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} are the 5 key principles around which the programme is structured:

- Working together in small groups
- Encouraging self-government and decision making
- A balanced and varied programme which is girls-led
- Caring for the individual
- Sharing a commitment to a common standard

These should be taken into consideration when planning your activities.

## Planning your programme

We want the girls to have a great guiding experience so it’s important to follow the fundamentals of good guiding when planning your programme.
