This virtual session for Girlguiding Hertfordshire members only will run from 7:30 - 8:30pm, and will cover the background to gift aid, what paperwork leaders will need from members and how to register with HMRC.

The Zoom log in details will be sent to those booked on to the training by the trainer after the booking deadline date.

**Booking deadine:** Monday, 26 September

**Cost:** Free

Some reading may be required prior to the virtual session and this will be provided via email.
