If you’re interested in training to improve your personal skills and get your girls into the hills, Anglia region are offering Girlguiding walking scheme levels 1 and 2 training and assessment over the weekend of **Friday 3 - Sunday 5 November** in the Peak District.

Details of the scheme can be found on the Girlguiding UK website's [walking scheme page.](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/information-for-volunteers/learning-and-development/leading-outdoor-adventures/walking-scheme/)  

Cost: **£135**, but this can often be reclaimed from your unit, county or region, depending on where you will use the qualification.  

This weekend can also be attended as a [social and log book walking weekend](/event/peak-district-social-walking/). See the event page for details and costs of this option.
