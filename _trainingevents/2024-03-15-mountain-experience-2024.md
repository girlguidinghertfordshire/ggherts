Learn how to navigate in the hills and on remote terrain using maps and compasses.

Whether you are planning to do your Silver or Gold Duke of Edinburgh Award (DofE), or participate in Hertfordshire (Scouts) Peak Assault competition, or just want to learn a new skill and have an adventure this could be the weekend for you.

This informal course, taking place from Friday 15 - Sunday 17 March, helps Rangers learn how to navigate for themselves and inspire them to do more hill and mountain walking.

 Cost: Â£70 (includes indoor accommodation and food)

Limited places remaining.

This event is in conjunction with the Scout Explorers.

This weekend can also be attended as a more social event. See event page for details of the [Mountain Experience (MK24)](/event/mountain-experience-2024/) weekend.
