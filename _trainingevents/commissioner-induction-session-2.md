This is the second of two online induction sessions for commissioners and commissioner designates within Anglia region, who have been in role for less than 6 months. They aim to inspire and equip you on your journey.

The sessions cover a range of topics, which are more detailed versions of the content given at the new commissioner training session at LEAP, in May.

This session takes place on Wednesday 29 March, 7.30pm-9.00pm via Zoom and covers the following:

- GO
- Unit visits and Doing our Best
- Growth and Retention
- Complaints and difficult behaviour
- Properties and/or land
- Awards and recognition
- Networking opportunity to meet air and share

**See also:** [Session 1](/training/commissioner-induction-session-1/), covering different topics. It takes place on Thursday 16 March and needs to be booked separately.
