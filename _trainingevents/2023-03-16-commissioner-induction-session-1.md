This is the first of 2 online induction sessions for commissioners and commissioner designates within Anglia region, who have been in role for less than 6 months. They aim to inspire and equip you on your journey.

The sessions cover a range of topics, which are more detailed versions of the content given at the new commissioner training session at LEAP, in May.

This session takes place on Thursday 16 March, 7.30pm-9.00pm via Zoom and covers the following:

- The commissioner role and what it means to be a commissioner
- Your team
- Where to find help and support
- Finance
- RENs
- Meetings
- Communication
- Networking opportunity to meet air and share

**See also:** [Session 2](/training/commissioner-induction-session-2/) covering further topics. It takes place on Wednesday 29 March and needs to be booked separately.
