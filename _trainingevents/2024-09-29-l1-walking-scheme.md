Come and join the walking team on **Saturday 29 September** in Watton at Stone for a fun day learning some new skills so you can take your girls out with confidence to explore nature reserves, local woodland, canal walks, complete an incident hike/orienteering/night hike or even visit the Chiltern Hills.

You will learn some simple map and compass skills, route planning, how to use a throw line, what kit to take, which Girlguiding Hertfordshire rules apply, what to put in a risk assessment and lots more.

Level 1 of the Girlguiding walking scheme is a fun and full course so, to ensure we can fit the training in to one day, there will also be an online session beforehand on either 9 or 10 September, in the evening, to enable us to cover the whole syllabus. Emphasis on fun!

For members aged 16+.

**Cost:** Â£12 chargeable to unit.

Email <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> to book your place or with any queries.
