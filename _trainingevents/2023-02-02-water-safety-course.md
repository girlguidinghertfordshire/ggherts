4-hour Water Safety course for members aged 16+ on **Saturday 25 February** from **1-5pm** in **Central Hertfordshire** (venue TBC).

![Walkers navigate stepping stones across a river](/assets/images/2023/01/stepping-stones.webp){:.float-end.m-3}
The course is essential for those undertaking the Walking Scheme qualification and extremely useful for all other leaders and anyone wanting to take girls out & about near water hazards such as canal walks or outings to the beach, or even more adventurous things such as coasteering or gorge walking.  

You will learn how to use a reaching aid, a buoyancy aid and a throw line. We will also talk about different types of water and their associated risks including environmental hazards such as poisonous waterside plants and signage & flags such as at the beach.  

We’ll help you find out what Girlguiding rules apply and how to go about running a water based activity.  

Please see the [Water Safety Course flyer](/assets/docs/2023/water-safety-25-feb-2023-flyer.pdf){:.download-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} for more information.

Cost: **£15** (you can claim from unit funds).

Contact Alison Tuch via <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> to book your place.
