This weekend at Whiteley Woods Outdoor Activity Centre in Sheffield will focus on the Girlguiding walking scheme level 2 training and assessment and for those who have reached the final hurdle, there will be the chance to complete the supported walk.  Water safety training will also be offered.

Depending on demand night navigation will be offered.

**Cost:** approximately Â£130 for training or assessment (includes accommodation at a bunk house and full catering). Final costs will be confirmed nearer the date.

This weekend can also be attended for a purely social walking experience, providing a great opportunity to build up your logbook.  More details on this option can be found on the Girlguiding Anglia website's walking events page: <https://www.girlguiding-anglia.org.uk/events/walking-events/2024-walking-events>

Contact the Anglia region walking lead volunteers on <walking@girlguiding-anglia.org.uk> to book.
