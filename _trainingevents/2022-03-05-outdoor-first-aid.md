**This event is now FULLY BOOKED**

This course is taking place on Saturday, 5 March and Sunday, 6th March 2022 in Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire

Emphasis will be on learning outside where possible with all scenarios on the hill or in woodland. 
 
The course is essential for those leading outdoor activities such as hillwalking, DofE expeditions, climbing or mountain biking.  It is also useful for anyone aged 16+ and wanting to take their first aid knowledge a little further than 1st Response.

**Cost:** Â£130. Funding is available for those needing Outdoor First Aid as part of another outdoor qualification which they are using for Girlguiding events.
