This 2 day Anglia region essential training on the hills is for those with outdoor activity qualifications but useful for anyone leading outdoor activities.  Participants must be aged 16+.

The first day of training takes place on **Saturday 11 May** at Windy Sayles, Whipsnade, Bedfordshire (9am - 6pm) and the second day **Saturday 29 June** based at Aston Rowant Nature Reserve in Buckinghamshire (9am - 6pm).  **Both days must be attended.**

Much of the teaching, and all of the scenarios, will be outside in open country, with some of it on steep grounds.

**Cost:** £149 per person. Financial assistance may be available if this qualification is part of an outdoor activity qualification. Transport is not included and participants will need to make their own travel arrangements.

This is a non residential event, but camping is available on site at a cost of £5 per person per night, and can be prearranged by contacting the region walking lead volunteers and paying the site directly.

Please email the Anglia region walking lead volunteer on <walking@girlguidinganglia.org.uk> with any queries.
