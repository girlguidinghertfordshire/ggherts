This 2 day Anglia region essential training on the hills (some steep) is for those with outdoor activity qualifications and suitable for members aged 16+.

Taking place on **Sat 11 - Sun 12 May** at Windy Sayles, Whipsnade, Bedfordshire, participants must attend both days.

**Cost:** £149 per person. Financial assistance may be available if this qualification is part of an outdoor activity qualification. Transport is not included.

This is a non residential event, but camping is available on site at a cost of £5 per person per night, and can be prearranged by contacting the region walking lead volunteers and paying the site directly.

Please email the Anglia region walking lead volunteer on <walking@girlguidinganglia.org.uk> with any queries.
