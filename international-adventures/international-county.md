## For young members

Guide and Ranger members aged 14-18 who want to travel the world with Girlguiding should be encouraged to attend the County International Opportunities Day, held each year in the autumn term.Â  The International Leadership Team have a day of activities and team challenges to allow them to get to know everyone. After successful completion, the team offer places on County trips for the next year and offer a small number of girls the opportunity to attend Anglia region selection. In recent years County trips have visited Ireland, The Gambia, Mexico, USA, India and the World Scout Jamboree.

## Leaders interested in leading/assisting with International opportunities in 2024

Are you a leader aged over 18 (from any section) and interested in taking groups of girls to international events either in this country or overseas in **2024**?  If so, you should attend the next county INTOPS event in 2023.  Please keep an eye on the county website's [Events page](/events/) where details of this event will be advertised.

If you have any queries please contact the International team via <international@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>
