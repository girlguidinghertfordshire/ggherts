## For young members

Guide and Ranger members aged 14-18 who want to travel the world with Girlguiding should be encouraged to attend the County International Opportunities Day, held each year in the autumn term.  The International Leadership Team have a day of activities and team challenges to allow them to get to know everyone. After successful completion, the team offer places on County trips for the next year and offer a small number of girls the opportunity to attend Anglia region selection. In recent years County trips have visited Ireland, The Gambia, Mexico, USA, India and the World Scout Jamboree.

If you have members who are interested in international opportunities then watch for the International Opportunities Day information in the monthly mailout and on the [events section.](/events/)

## Leaders needed to Lead/assist with International opportunities in 2021

The international team are looking for a number of Leaders aged over 18 from any section to take groups of girls to International events both in this country and overseas in 2021.  If you would like to apply or for more information then please email <international@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> with details of your experience and whether you would be interested in an overseas trip or in taking a County group to a UK Jamboree.
