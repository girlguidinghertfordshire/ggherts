## National opportunities

Girlguiding offers a number of national opportunities, please see their website for the most up to date details: [girlguiding.org.uk/what-we-do/international-adventures](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/what-we-do/international-adventures/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} Members from the County have taken part in GOLD, Moot, Roverway and the World Scout Jamboree. If you are interested in finding out more from someone with personal experience, then let us know and we can put you in touch.

### GOLD projects

There will be no GOLD projects in 2025.

GOLD will be taking a year off, prior to a relaunch, in 2026, to enable Girlguiding to redesign the scheme, to ensure it better meets the needs of both Girlguiding UK and our partners around the world.  

You can find out more about GOLD on [Girlguiding UK website’s](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/what-we-do/international-adventures/gold/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}

## WAGGGS Opportunities

Each of the World Centres is staffed by a small international team of volunteers and paid employees.  Volunteering opportunities are available to members over the age of 18 for periods ranging from a couple of weeks to a year.
