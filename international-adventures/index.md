Welcome to the Girlguiding Hertfordshire International Adventures.

The International Leadership Team are here to support you plan an amazing adventure. 

As part of the largest worldwide organisation for girls and young women, with 10 million members in 150 countries, international activities are a big part of the fun, friendship, challenge and adventure that Girlguiding has to offer.

Whether it’s taking part in a day visit to an International camp or halfway round the globe at a World Centre, there are so many ways that International Girlguiding can be a part of both your own and your unit’s experiences. You don’t even have to leave your unit meeting!

As International Advisers it is our role to bring international guiding to Hertfordshire. We have a successful programme of county trips, support leaders taking their units abroad and advertise new international resources. Keep an eye out in ‘Share’ or the monthly mail-out for international news or read more below.
