## For young members
Region opportunities for young members can only be accessed by applying through the County.Â  The exception to this is ICE (International Community Experience) which is aimed at Guides aged 11-14. Young members need to apply directly to Girlguiding Anglia to take part and the information can be found on the Girlguiding Anglia website: <a href="http://www.girlguiding-anglia.org.uk/events.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.girlguiding-anglia.org.uk/events.asp</a>
