## For young members

Region opportunities for young members can only be accessed by applying through the County.Â  

The exception to this is ICE (International Community Experience) which is aimed at Guides aged 11-14. Young members need to apply directly to Girlguiding Anglia to take part and the information can be found on the [Girlguiding Anglia website][1]{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}{:.external-link}

## For adults

Leaders who are interested in leading a region trip may apply directly to region and their event information can be found on the [Girlguiding Anglia Website][1]{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}{:.external-link} (usually held in May/June).
