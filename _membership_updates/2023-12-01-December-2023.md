Email Membership Systems for support on <membership@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> only.

### Compliance lists

Compliance lists are received regularly from HQ via region, roughly every 2 weeks. These are lists of people who have failed to complete their a safe space or DBS within the time allowed and are now in the process of having their membership removed or refused.

On receipt of the list, emails are sent to dcs/main contacts and division commissioners for action. There is usually a short grace period (around 10 days) in which to complete the requirements. Please be aware that anyone on a current list is regarded as non-compliant. They should not attend any meetings until they have completed the a safe space training(s) and/or DBS required.

### New enquiries/leader in training roles

Please be aware that the leader in training (LiT) role should not be used for any new enquiries, a unit helper role should be used initially. This is because the LiT role now requires the initial stages of enrolment on the ‘Becoming a Leader’ course to be completed. before it can be added to GO.
