### LQ Mentor Roles to be deactivated

All Leadership Qualifications and modules have now been completed or marked as abandoned (except the one waiting on verification of a 1st Response). All the County LQ mentor roles will now be deactivated within the next week or two. Mentors for the new Leader Development Programme will be given a County LDP Mentor role.

### Commissioner Training

If any commissioners would like to have a one-to-one (or two where roles are joint) GO training please contact Sheila on membership@girlguiding
