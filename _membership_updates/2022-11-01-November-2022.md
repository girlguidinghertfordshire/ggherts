### Young Leader/Young External Volunteers logins to GO and the Learning Platform

When a young member volunteers at the age of 14+ their existing girl record, on GO will be split off from any parent/carer record and the parentâ€™s email address removed.  

Commissioners will then need to add the girls own unique email address for her. They will not be able to create their logins to GO and the Learning Platform until this is done.

### How to Register as a Leader in Training

The Leader in Training role can no longer be added until some prerequisite training has been completed on the Learning Platform.

The How to Register as a Leader in Training document provides detailed instructions on what needs to be done.
