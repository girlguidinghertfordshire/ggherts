### GO Communications

#### 6-month role expiry communications stopped

GO communications sent to commissioners and individuals 6 months before a role is about to expire have been stopped as part of the work to reduce the number of communications sent out. You can check if your role has an expiry date on the [My roles](https://go.girlguiding.org.uk/profile/my-roles/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} page on GO.

Commissioners can also use the needs supervision tab on GO to see any volunteers in their area with expired roles. See the [Using the needs supervision tab helpfile](https://gggoportal.blob.core.windows.net/goportal/help/Check%20if%20volunteers%20need%20supervision%20-%20for%20commissioners%20or%20level%20support.pdf){:.download-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} for more information.

#### 6-month course expiry communications for commissioners stopped

GO communications sent to commissioners when a course for someone in their area is due to expire in 6 months, have been stopped as part of the work to reduce the number of communications sent out. Commissioners can still use the needs supervision tab on GO to keep track of anyone who needs to complete a course. See the [Using the needs supervision tab helpfile](https://gggoportal.blob.core.windows.net/goportal/help/Check%20if%20volunteers%20need%20supervision%20-%20for%20commissioners%20or%20level%20support.pdf){:.download-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} for more information. A new [Safer guiding communications on GO helpfile](https://gggoportal.blob.core.windows.net/goportal/help/Safer%20guiding%20communications%20on%20GO.pdf){:.download-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} for commissioners explaining the automated GO communications sent about safer guiding, has been created.
