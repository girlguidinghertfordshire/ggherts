### Mentors/DCs/Leaders in Training - Current LQ Completions using the workbook

Please make sure that when completions for the ‘old’ LQ are submitted that training for 1st Response and Safe Space are all valid. We will not be able to add a completed LQ unless these are in place. All completions need to be submitted by the end of August to allow time for the county verification process to be completed before the cut-off date. Anyone not completing the LQ before the hard cut-off date in August/September will need to start on the new LDP from scratch.

### Safe Space training with 13-year-olds

Please be aware that even if a 13-year-old has completed the Safe Space designed for them, they will need to complete the 14-17 year old training on turning 14.

### Learning Platform/GO not synced for some older training

Some training that was delayed in being added to the Learning Platform has not synced correctly with GO because the completion date was in the past. The date on the Learning Platform is correct but the one on GO may be incorrect and you may find that you are still appearing on the compliance lists. Please do let <membership@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> know if you are aware of anything like this, so that they can collate the information to be passed to HQ and your record updated.
