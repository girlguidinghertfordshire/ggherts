### Safer Guiding/DBS Communications from GO

Most Communications from the GO system will be in the form of a message, within GO. To make sure you have every chance of seeing these messages it is advisable, in your personal profile, to set your communication preference to Email. You will also need to set ‘Email when I receive a Message’ to Yes.
