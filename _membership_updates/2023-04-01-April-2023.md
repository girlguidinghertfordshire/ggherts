### Young volunteers and a safe space training – change to role status

From 11 April, all young volunteer roles will become active. Volunteers under 18-years-old will still need to complete the appropriate safe space training but Girlguiding have updated GO so that a young volunteer’s role will be active, instead of active-pending, even if they haven’t yet completed the training.  

Commissioners will be able to find out which young volunteers still need to complete their training through a new option on the safe practice tab in GO. It is still advisable for them to complete their training, but this can happen at a pace that suits them. **If a young volunteer is attending a residential event, they must complete the training.**

### New and updated resources in GO  

Many help files and videos have been updated in the GO help zone. Please use these before contacting membership support.
