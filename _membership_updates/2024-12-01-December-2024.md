### County/division/district senior section adviser roles

These roles have now been changed to county/division/district Ranger adviser. Please check that these roles are still needed and appropriate.

### Commonwealth award

The Commonwealth award is being withdrawn on 4 December. If you have girls who have started on this, please notify our county Commonwealth award lead volunteer on <commonwealth@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> so that badges and certificates can be bought while they are still available.

### Digital DBS â€“ be aware there are two parts to this process

Some people are not aware that there are two parts to the digital DBS process. There is the set up of the Digital ID and then they need to log back into the system to complete their personal information (the 5 years of address, any name changes etc). Please do make sure that when people say they have completed the process, that they have done both parts.

### DBS not updating automatically on GO

DBS are still not updating automatically onto GO. If you can see that it has been completed please contact <disclosures@girlguiding.org.uk> and ask them to do this manually. A list of 26 from the county were sent last week and these have all now been update.
