Sorry folks, there’s a lot of information this month! Not necessarily in order of importance.  

**_Please do not send any more County Leadership Qualification forms, these are now obsolete._**

The _Leadership Qualification_ has been replaced by the **Leader Development Programme (LDP)**

### Leader Development Programme

The new Leader Development Programme has been launched and replaces the old Leadership Qualification.  Anybody who has already started on the old LQ with the Leadership Qualification book can continue following the course in their LQ book but please note that they have only 1 year (until September 2023) to complete.

Anybody who was already a leader in training but who had not yet had a mentor appointed, has had a ‘new’ Leadership qualification added onto their GO record by HQ.  Maureen Kell is working through this list to appoint mentors. When a mentor is appointed, [Maureen](/about-us/county-team/maureen-kell/) will discuss the way forward for these people.

The leader in training role can now only be added once a volunteer has completed the registration requirements on the Learning Platform. They must choose one of the following options:

#### Option 1  

Do ‘Getting started in Girlguiding’ and ‘Growing in Girlguiding’. They can then register to begin the leader training. Their commissioner will be notified to change their role to leader in training and then ‘Becoming a leader’ will be unlocked.

#### Option 2  

If they’ve been volunteering for a while, they can check their Girlguiding knowledge. If they pass the quiz, their commissioner will be notified to change their role to leader in training and then ‘Becoming a leader’ will be unlocked.

New enquirers should be added as a unit helper first, to help welcome and settle them into guiding.

Young Leaders can still start the ‘Becoming a Leader’ training from the age of 16 and should complete option 1 or 2 as above. It is, as yet, unclear to us exactly how this will appear on their GO record.

For more information and to see FAQs answered, logon to the [Learning Platform](https://learning.girlguiding.org.uk){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} and go to Leader Development Programme.

### GO Update – emergency contact forms and time in guiding errors

These errors in GO have now been fixed. Please contact <membership@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> if you encounter any other problems.  

### New GO Help Files for Volunteers and Parent/Carers

GO help files are being revised and updated. Two notable additions, for Volunteers and Parent/Carers, offer help in using GO and creating logins for both GO and the Learning Platform. Please ask anyone having difficulty logging in to read and follow any suggestions in these files. Links to the files can be found below and on the GO login page.

[Using GO for Volunteers](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/go-for-volunteers/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} and [How to use GO for Parents and Carers](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/go-for-parents/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}

If they still have difficulty, please contact your County GO Coordinator.

### Safe Space for under 18s

There is now a Safe Space for 10-13 year olds. This consists of various activity sheets that should be completed with support from their unit leader or parent.  

The course for 14-17 year olds can be found on the Learning Platform. They will need to login and complete it there.  The 14-17 A Safe Space is equal to both A Safe Space levels 1 and 2 in all circumstances. RENs can be signed off where young leaders and young external volunteers have this completed.  

More information, links to activities and guidance for leaders, can be found on the Girlguiding website ['A Safe Space for under 18s' page.](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/learning-and-development/a-safe-space-training/a-safe-space-level-1--an-introduction/a-safe-space-for-under-18s/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}

### Safeguarding requirements for parent helpers, recognised volunteers, individual support volunteers and external visitors 

Parents and family members who sign up to a rota should read the [Unit safeguarding guidelines](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/running-your-unit/safeguarding-and-risk/unit-safeguarding-guidelines/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}. You could send these out alongside a letter or have them on a noticeboard next to the rota for people to read as they sign up. Helping on a Parent Rota is not a recognised volunteer role and does not need to be recorded on GO. However, anyone who volunteers more than twice a term should be supported to move to a formal volunteer role, such as unit helper, and complete the necessary recruitment and vetting checks.

If a parent or carer is attending every week to support a young member with additional needs they should register as an [individual support unit helper](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/globalassets/docs-and-resources/volunteer-roles/individual-support-unit-helper-role-description.pdf){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}, and complete the necessary recruitment and vetting checks for this role. Adding them on GO will also mean they receive newsletters and other volunteer information.
