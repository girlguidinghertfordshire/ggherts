### Role Changes

#### Mentor Roles

All Leadership Qualification Mentor roles are being/have been changed to County
Level, in readiness for the new LQ to be launched on the learning platform.

#### Occasional Helper Roles

Most, if not all, of the Occasional Helper type roles at District, Division
or County level, have now been changed to District/Division/County Helper roles. These roles all
now require a DBS check and Safe Space Levels 1 and 2, please encourage people to complete
these as soon as possible.

These new Helper roles have optional membership and do not accrue service, even if membership
is set to ‘Member’. If membership is set to Recognised Volunteer, they will not attract
subscriptions.

Unit Helper roles will continue to require a DBS check, Safe Space Levels 1 and 2, have mandatory
membership and will accrue service.

All Girlguiding roles now need at least Safe Space Level 1. Nearly all roles also need either a DBS
check or require mandatory membership, often both.
