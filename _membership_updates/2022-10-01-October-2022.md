Short and sweet this month!

### Leader Development Programme – no automatic notification to DC

Contrary to initial information, there is no automatic notification sent to DCs when a volunteer enrols on the ‘Becoming a Leader’ course, on the Learning Platform. The volunteer will need to notify their DC themselves so that a Leader in Training role can be added for them and a mentor appointed.

### GO Update – Emergency Contact and Individual Details reports – fixed (again) – new instructions

Both the Individual Details and Emergency Contacts reports should now be working again. There will be some new instructions which will hopefully be on the page in GO itself (not there yet when I last looked) and should be in the next Making Guiding Happen newsletter.

The report is large and will take a few minutes to run. To keep everyone's data secure, the report will be deleted from GO 15 minutes after it has been downloaded.
