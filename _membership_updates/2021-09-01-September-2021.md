### Recognised Prior Learning for Safe Space Level 3 – Suspended
Please be aware that the **suspension of recognised prior learning** for A Safe Space Level 3 is now in force, pending a review. _There is currently no alternative to completing the Girlguiding training._

### DBS Extension Period Ended
The extension period for DBS renewals, granted due to Covid-19, ended on 1/9/21. Anyone who
has not started a new DBS check will now be at the final stage of the compliance process, which is
withdrawal of membership. Some volunteers may still be able to apply for mitigating
circumstances to allow for their deadline to be extended. Mitigating circumstances would be
personal events or situations that place significant barriers to them being able to complete their
disclosure. Volunteers should contact compliance@girlguiding.org.uk to request an extension of
their deadline through mitigating circumstances or their Commissioner could apply on their behalf,
if they are not able to do this themselves.

### Current Covid-19 guidance
The Covid-19 guidance has recently been updated on the Girlguiding website. Please read the up-
to-date information on [https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/coronavirus-keeping-safe/](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/coronavirus-keeping-safe/)

### Current Risk Assessments
Please continue to use the Covid-19 risk assessment when guiding. If you have had a face to face risk
assessment signed off by your commissioner already, you don’t need to resubmit another risk
assessment for sign off unless: 

1. This is your first time meeting face to face since March 2020.
2. There has been a big change in circumstance ie a change to your venue or you’re planning to
move from outdoor to indoor guiding. Remember, you should still review it regularly yourself
even if it’s been signed off to make sure it reflects any changes in guidance too.

Full information can be found here: [https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/coronavirus-keeping-safe/meetings-during-covid-19/indoor-meetings/](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/coronavirus-keeping-safe/meetings-during-covid-19/indoor-meetings/)

### Historic Roles, Missing Qualifications and Service
If you have any missing volunteer roles or qualifications on your GO record, we are being given
another opportunity to add these. We don’t have long as any request needs to be with the HQ
Membership Systems team by 30 th November. Roles, in particular can change the amount of service
that you have gained.

Email HQ on [membershipsystems@girlguiding.org.uk](mailto:membershipsystems@girlguiding.org.uk) For roles they will need to know your membership number, role held, name of unit/district/division, level number (if known) and start and end date. For qualifications they need to know your membership number, name of qualification and start and completion dates. Please copy any email to [membership@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk](mailto:membership@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk) and [cc@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk](mailto:cc@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk) so that Sheila and Jenny are aware. If you need any help please contact Sheila in the first instance.
