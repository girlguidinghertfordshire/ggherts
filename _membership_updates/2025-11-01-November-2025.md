### Going away with scheme

Recent issues with assigning going away with mentors on GO, and leaders returning to Girlguiding after a break being unable to complete the current going away with scheme, have now been fixed.

### Going away with (online)

A new section has been added to the learning tab on GO, for commissioners/level support, called going away with (online). This will be used for the new online going away with qualification, to be launched on the learning platform soon. Anyone doing the current going away with scheme will continue to appear in the existing going away with scheme section on GO.

### Changes to ‘Volunteer Enquiries’ tab

A new column called 'alternative title' has been added to the Volunteer Enquiries tab for commissioners/level support. This column will show 'young volunteer enquirer' for any enquirers under 18, making it easier to tell these apart from adult volunteer enquiries.

For now, this column will show either 'volunteer enquirer' or 'expression of interest' for adult volunteer enquiries. There is no difference between these but there are more changes to come that will add more useful information.
