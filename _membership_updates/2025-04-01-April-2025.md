### Safer guiding and DBS compliance

Please be aware that when a volunteer breaches the deadline for their safer guiding or DBS, they are no longer compliant with Girlguiding policy and procedure. They therefore should not be volunteering and must not attend any Girlguiding meetings or events until this has been resolved.

If there are personal or technical problems an extension can be applied for, but this should be done as early as possible.  

### Safer guiding e-learning

There are 2 courses in the safer guiding family, safer guiding basics and safer guiding.

If your role requires the full safer guiding course, you do not need to complete the basics course first. The content of the basics course is included in the full course.  

### Safer guiding â€“ district helpers

District helpers are now required to complete the full safer guiding course, not safer guiding basics.

### Safer guiding - 3 quiz attempts then section locked

Each of the 4 sections of the safer guiding course ends with a quiz. You are allowed 3 attempts at the quiz before the section is locked. If someone fails 1 section quiz, they will need to talk to a safer guiding trainer about the section they have failed. If they fail more than 1 section quiz, they will need to attend a webinar. Webinars must be booked via the learning platform and take place over 2 sessions; both must be attended to complete the course
