### References for Rangers, young leaders and young external volunteers who have turned 18

The letter of commendation process for young members moving into adult volunteer roles has been replaced.  Instead, they will need 1 reference when they turn 18. For young leaders and young external volunteers, a reference request will automatically be sent to their unit leader. For Rangers, the individual or their commissioner should contact disclosures@girlguiding.org.uk to ask for a reference request to be sent to their unit leader. 

### New safe practice report for commissioners

A new safe practice report for commissioners, and those with level support access, has been added to the reports area on GO, showing data about safer guiding, disclosures and compliance. You can use the filters on the report to show data for your area.
