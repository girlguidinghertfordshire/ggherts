### Subscriptions – Check invoices carefully

We are aware that there have been a few live invoices where the number of girls or adults is incorrect. This has only affected invoices where late changes were made on 21 February, the last day that changes were allowed. Please check your invoices carefully if you made changes on that day, and report any error to <subscriptions@girlguiding.org.uk>

### Setting up access to GO and the Learning Platform

To set up a learning platform account, you will first need to have registered an account on GO, our membership database, with your email address and chosen username. GO and the Learning Platform are two separate systems, but they do ‘talk’ to each other. You can set different passwords for each system, but the username will always be the same.  Please be aware that if you change the password on one system it will not change on the other.

If you have never logged in to GO before you can use the ‘Don’t have a login’ button, on the GO login screen, to receive an invitation code. Please make sure you use the same email address which you have used in your enquiry or, if you are already a member, the one on your GO record.

You will receive an invitation code by email. When you have the code, click on the Redeem Invitation tab to enter the code and register your account.

After you have set up your GO account, a learning platform account will automatically be set up for you within 24 hours.

When you are ready to access your learning platform account you can use this link to the login page <https://learning.girlguiding.org.uk/login/index.php>

The bottom grey button entitled ‘first time here’ will open a section explaining how to access the platform.

To set your password, click the forgotten password link, which will send an email with a reset link.

Click on the reset link in your email and input a new password.

You will then be able to access the platform and complete your ‘A Safe Space’ or any other e-learnings and webinars you are interested in. Any e-learnings you complete will take 24 - 48 hours to synchronize over to your GO account.

If you have any trouble accessing the platform, completing the e-learning or your course has not registered on GO, please email <membershipsystems@girlguiding.org.uk> and they should be able to help.

### Unit Occasional Helper (UOH) roles - remaining roles to be changed by HQ 

Thank you to everyone who changed UOH roles before the close of the subscriptions process. We do still have 26 within the county and these remaining roles will now be automatically changed, by HQ, to Unit Helper, by the end of March. For those that do not already have a valid DBS check, this will start the 120-day period where they will be required to complete a disclosure check, which is needed for the Unit Helper role. The new role will attract subscriptions next year.

### More Role Changes – District/Division/County Residential Occasional Helpers(ROH)/Occasional Helpers(OH)

District/Division/County ROH/OH roles will be changed, by HQ, to District/Division/County Helper, by end of March. The implication for the ROH role is simply a name change. 

There will, however, be implications for the OH role. We have previously fallen back on this role as one of the only ones that did not require a DBS. The new Helper role will require a DBS, which must be completed within 120 days of the role being changed, and Safe Space Level 2. Membership will still be optional, with the decision being made by the local commissioner. 

### DBS Changes – Change to length of validity/investigation into using Update Service

From 26 April, DBS renewal dates will be changed from five years to three years. This will bring it in line with A Safe Space renewal and best practice across the youth sector. This will only affect new volunteers and those renewing. Existing volunteers won’t need to renew their disclosure check until the expiry date that is showing on their GO record.

Good news for many - Girlguiding will be exploring, this year, whether the DBS update service would be beneficial.
