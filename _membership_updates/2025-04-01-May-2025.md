### Needs supervision tab

This new tab on GO shows people whose roles are active-ending and therefore need to be supervised when involved in meetings with young members. This can be for a variety of reasons and there is a help file link within the tab. Do please check anyone on this list and update roles or encourage completion of recruitment checks and renewals of DBS and safer guiding.

### Timeline of the compliance process

Volunteers will receive an email 40 days before they need to renew any mandatory training or criminal disclosure checks.

Here's the timeline for each stage of the compliance process. As a commissioner, you'll receive an email if the volunteer reaches the 'at risk' stage. This will ask you to support the volunteer. The role will become active pending and they won't be able to volunteer unsupervised.

- Stage 1: Inform (40 days before your valid to date)
- Stage 2: At risk (40 days after your valid to date)
