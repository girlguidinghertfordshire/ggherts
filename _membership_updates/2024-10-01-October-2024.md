### New Disclosure and Barring service (DBS) process

A new method of completing a DBS has been introduced. The old method will remain in place for those who are unable to complete by the new method. The new process does not involve an ID Verifier and can be completed entirely by the individual concerned. This is a digital process and involves the downloading of an app to a phone or tablet, so may not be suitable for everyone. Anyone becoming due to complete a new DBS should receive an email with instructions on how to download the app, set up a login and complete their application.
