### Volunteer roles tables

New guidance has been issued, in the form of tables, set out by volunteering role(s). These tell you what level of safer guiding is required, whether a disclosure check is needed and whether membership is optional.

They also show what access a person has to GO and whether service is accrued.

They can be found on this page: [girlguiding.org.uk/information-for-volunteers/volunteer-roles-in-guiding/volunteer-roles-requirements](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/information-for-volunteers/volunteer-roles-in-guiding/volunteer-roles-requirements/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}

All helper roles (unit, district, division and county) must complete the full safer guiding course, not the safer guiding basics.

Please make sure that people are aware of the difference and this change.

### Commissioners/level support - Safer guiding views and timeline

There are now 5 views under the ‘safer guiding’ tab

![Safer guiding menu options](/assets/images/2025/03/safer-guiding-menu.webp){:.img-fluid}

The most important date on the views is the ‘deadline date’. This is the latest date a volunteer can complete training, or start a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check before head quarters sanctions are initiated. If there are reasons why this cannot be done, such as personal circumstances, accessibility needs, or there is no training session they can attend please email <membership@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> before the deadline. An extension can then be applied for on the volunteer’s behalf.
