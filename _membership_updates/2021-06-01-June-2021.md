### Online REN Forms/Learning Tab
Online REN forms can currently only be seen by commissioners. This is causing problems in making them accessible to advisers. HQ have said that “In the next few weeks, we will be renaming the ‘Learning’ area on GO to be called ‘adviser/coordinator’ to better reflect what the area is used for and who it is used by. If you currently use the area, aside from the change of name nothing will be different. If you’re a residential, international or outdoor activity adviser you’ll be given access to the area, so you can see and give advice on REN forms submitted in your area.” Meanwhile, you are still able to use paper forms.

### Unit Occasional Helpers
We still have 183 Unit Occasional Helper roles within county. They must be changed, locally, as soon as possible, to avoid HQ changing them automatically to Unit Helpers. It would be better to discuss this change with your UOH now, so that you can decide what the right role for them would be. Please be aware that a Unit Helper role will require a DBS check, Safe Space Levels 1 &amp; 2 and will attract subscriptions when they are due next year. An alternative might be to move them to district level where the Occasional Helper roles are still available.
