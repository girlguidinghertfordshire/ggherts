### Changing Email addresses on a GO record

An email address can only be changed for a volunteer or girl, by a DC or Unit Leader, when the record does not have a GO login associated with it.

Once a record has a GO login, it is the person’s (or their parent’s, if a girl) responsibility to keep their details up to date. In particular, they are the only person who can change their email address. In the event that they are unable to do this for themselves, only Membership Systems at HQ can help.
