### Programme records for girls moving units within the same section

Improvements have been made to programme recording to make it easier when someone moves to a new unit within the same section (e.g. from 1st .... Brownie unit to 2nd .... Brownie unit).  The original theme awards they started in their old unit will now automatically move across to the new unit. You will no longer need to manually add any UMAs, skills builders or interest badges they completed whilst in their old unit.

### ‘Underage’ column being removed from waiting lists

Over the next few weeks changes will be made to simplify the waiting list views to make it easier to find the information you need. For now, you may notice the ‘underage’ column has been removed from some of the views. This should fix issues caused by this field not updating correctly – you can still check if someone is underage by using the ‘age’ or ‘allowed to start’ columns.
