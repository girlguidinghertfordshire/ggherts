### Email the county membership systems coordinator

- <membership@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>

### Young leaders (YLs) and young external volunteers (YEVs) with no email

Please ensure that all young leaders and young external volunteers have a valid email address. When their role is created their record is split off from any parent record and in the process the email address for the parent is removed. Commissioners must then add the young volunteers own email address. Without an email address they will not be able to create their logins to GO and the learning platform, and without which they will not be able to do their a safe space training.  

### GO login problems

There have been a lot of problems with the introduction of the new login system for GO and the learning platform. Hopefully these have been rectified now. Please, do let the county membership systems coordinator know if you are still experiencing problems.
