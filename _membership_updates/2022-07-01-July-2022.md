### Update on GO problems

Hopefully, the majority of problems with GO have now been resolved in the roll back that took place in early June. If you do encounter any further problems, please contact our county Membership Systems Co-ordinator who will chase them up with HQ.

### Help with GO login problems

There are 2 new pages on the Girlguiding website containing guidance and help for both volunteers and parent/carers logging in for the first time or having trouble logging on.

### For ID Verifiers

#### News

A ‘News’ link has been added to the DBS website. Here you can find information about any updates to the site including the information about the new facility to [cancel and restart](#cancel-and-restart) a DBS, allowing information to be edited.

#### Cancel and restart

We know from your feedback that sometimes when you cancel an application, you may still need to process a DBS check for the applicant. The current process requires you to cancel the first application and initiate a new one from scratch.

We're delighted to let you know that we've introduced a **Cancel & Restart** option.  Now when you cancel an application you'll have two options: **Cancel** and **Cancel & Restart** the application.

When you choose the **Cancel & Restart** option, you'll be able to initiate a new application in one seamless process.

Depending on your access, you'll be able to make a few changes to the new application:

- choose a new branch or course
- edit the applicant details e.g. applicant name, email address or job role.

You'll also be able to review and correct any of the applicant details you entered when you initiated the application.

Please note that applications cancelled and restarted via this new process may not send status updates or result updates to your CRM system. Applications initiated via your integration will need to be cancelled in the normal way i.e. via the integration.

This feature is live in your system today, we hope that you find this new feature easy to use and an enhancement to the current cancellation process.

### Changes to Programme

There has been a raft of changes to the programme and programme recording over the last couple of years and many temporary changes, brought in to help through the pandemic, have now been made permanent. For full details follow this link to the Girlguiding website:

### Rainbows

In August, the young members’ policy will change so that Rainbows can start at 4-years-old.

### A Safe Space Level 3 - Recognised Prior Learning

After reviewing A Safe Space Level 3, the decision has been made that Recognised Prior Learning will no longer be taken into account, as it is important that all volunteers have the same training. If you already have a current approved RPL, you won’t be affected until your Safe Space Level 3 is up for renewal.

### Rebranding

You should all have received an email about the future rebranding of Girlguiding. This will start in January 2023 with various updates over the following 2 years.
