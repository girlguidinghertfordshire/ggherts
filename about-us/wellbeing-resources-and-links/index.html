<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Parachute-Plan.pdf">Parachute Plan</a> &#8211; A parachute exists to keep people safe. Unless you’re a skydiver, it’s something that most people hope they will never have to use. It’s there in case something goes really wrong, and it enables the wearer to quickly get themselves out of a dangerous situation into a place of safety.</p>
