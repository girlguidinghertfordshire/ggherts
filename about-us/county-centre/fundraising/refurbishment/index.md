Phase 1 works of the county centre refurbishment project are due to commence on Monday 2 December 2024.  This much anticipated start to re-modernising the centre, and making it more inclusive for all, has at last arrived!

Phase 1 includes accessible wet rooms, dormitory space and a new main entrance for greater accessibility and prominence.

This page will be updated as works progress to keep you informed.

Your fundraising efforts are still very much needed, and appreciated, to help raise funds for phase 2 works.
