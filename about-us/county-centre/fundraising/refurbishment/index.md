Phase 1 works of the county centre refurbishment project commenced on Monday 2 December 2024. 

Works are now well underway to modernise the centre, making it more inclusive for all.  Phase 1 includes accessible wet rooms, dormitory space and a new main entrance for greater accessibility and prominence.

Take a look at the photos below and see how the project is progressing.
