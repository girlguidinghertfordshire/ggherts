        <p class="lead">We are pleased to announce the launch of our fundraising campaign to enable the refurbishment of
            the county centre and would like every member of Girlguiding Hertfordshire to be involved.</p>
        <p>The Hertfordshire Guide Centre (HGC) at Cottered has been the county headquarters since 1996 and the time has
            come to give it a new lease of life, bring it up to date, ensure that it is accessible and inclusive for
            everyone, create an environmentally friendly building and make it a centre to be proud of.</p>
        <h2>Our vision</h2>
        <p>We want the centre to become a flagship venue which appeals to units across Hertfordshire as well as
            neighbouring counties. By upgrading HGC we will enhance our reputation locally within Cottered village as
            well as with our members and their families.</p>
        <p>HGC currently has a wealth of opportunity waiting to be unlocked, with its amazing grounds and camping
            facilities, we aim to build on this to create a venue with many activities for visitors to enjoy both from
            within and outside of Girlguiding Hertfordshire.</p>
        <p>Looking after the leaders is an important part of the upgrade. The leader's accommodation will be improved
            along with the washroom facilities for everyone.</p>
        <h3>Accessible to all</h3>
        <p>We want the centre to be fully inclusive. The refurbishment will ensure that we can accommodate visitors with
            all types of disabilities, including a separate washroom that will allow enough space to accommodate a
            changing table. The new sleeping accommodation will be changed to dormitories that will allow all mixed
            groups to stay at HGC. The dormitories will also be being built to allow easy access to all and fitting
            extra equipment such as a hoist, to assist all.</p>
        <h3>Environmental impact</h3>
        <p>Currently the centre is very inefficient with regards to our environmental impact. The heating system will be
            upgraded using a sustainable heat pump system, LED lights will be fitted along with double glazed windows
            and doors. In time we would like to install solar panels which could not only meet our own electricity
            demands but provide income by selling excess to the grid. All of this will reduce our carbon footprint and
            we can make a positive impact on the environment whilst reducing the centre running costs.</p>
        <p>By upgrading the centre, we aim to make it a self-funding enterprise that meets the needs of all units in
            Hertfordshire and neighbouring counties, a flagship venue, and the venue of choice for events and
            activities.</p>
        <h2>Our target</h2>
        <p>We need your help to raise £300,000 to make the vision a reality.</p>
