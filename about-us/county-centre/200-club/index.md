Due to a reduction in membership over the last few years the difficult decision has been made that December 2023 draw of the 200 Club will be the final one.

On behalf of the HGC management committee, past and present, we would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your support over the years, we are very grateful to each and every one of you.
