You may think we’ve been very quiet, but we have been beavering away in the background and now have nearly all our books catalogued. It does all take time. However as fast as we work our way through things there is more appearing all the time. Not that we’re complaining, keep it coming!

With the new programme changeover on the 22nd July you may be wondering what to do with all your old resources, badges, books etc. Never fear! We have a home for some of them here in the archives. Obviously, we can only keep so many, space is limited. We will accept anything but will pass on anything that is of no use or of which we have enough, to Herts Guide Centre, Cottered or to County International Advisers for fundraising.

I know some people are worried about what they can and can’t keep now, with GDPR to the fore. Girlguiding have issued some guidance which can be <a href="https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/running-your-unit/membership-administration/gdpr/what-you-can-and-cant-keep-gdpr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found here</a>
However, if you’re unsure about something, do ask and we’ll do our best to advise, we would hate to see our heritage thrown away. Please contact [Sheila Hill](mailto:archives@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk) if you have something you feel would benefit the County Archives. If you are submitting scrapbooks and photos to the archives please do try to make sure that they are annotated with as much detail as possible, names in pencil (preferably 2B not HB) on the backs of photos or with an accompanying note would be lovely. Most photos are of little use unless we can identify who, when, where and why.

## Can you help?

Meanwhile…. Can anyone tell us what the above object is, where it came from or what it was used for? It is triangular with a hole in the top, perhaps for something with a very small diameter pole. The hole isn’t big enough for a Guide or Brownie flag pole. And why 75? Any information would be great, otherwise it may have to be consigned to the great archive in the sky!
