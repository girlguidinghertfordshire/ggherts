Girlguiding Hertfordshire has been a significant part of the Girlguiding movement for over 100 years.

Our county archivists maintain, organise and expand the county archive collection which covers the history of guiding in Hertfordshire.

Hertfordshire Guide Centre (HGC), in Cottered, houses many of these items and our archivists are always grateful for any donations to expand this historic collection.

Please email [archives@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk](mailto:archives@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk) if you have something you feel would benefit the collection or be of historic interest. Give a description and/or photo of the item(s) and any background information where possible.

If you are submitting scrapbooks and photos please make sure that they are annotated with as much detail as possible, including names of those featured, in pencil (preferably 2B not HB) on the backs, and any additional information (dates, locations, event etc).

As space is limited only so many items can be kept but please do ask; we would hate to see our heritage thrown away.

Girlguiding have issued guidance on [collecting, using and destroying personal data](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/information-for-volunteers/policies/managing-information-policy/managing-information-procedure/collecting-using-and-destroying-personal-data/){:.external-link}{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. If you are unsure whether something can be retained for historical purposes under GDPR our county archivists can offer advice.

If you would like to borrow any items from the county archives collection to show at your events or to your members, at unit meetings, please email [archives@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk](mailto:archives@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk).
