> _“As a county, we are committed to working in alignment with the mission statements from both Girlguiding UK and Girlguiding Anglia. We will provide a balanced programme full of fun, adventure and experiences to develop our members to grow and be the best that they can be in all elements of their lives.”_

## UK and Anglia mission statements

As our mission refers to Girlguiding UK and Girlguiding Anglia mission statements, they can be seen below for reference.


### Girlguiding UK Mission Statement

> _“Through fun, friendship, challenge and adventure we empower girls to find their voice, inspiring them to discover the best in themselves and to make a positive difference in their community.”_

### Girlguiding Anglia Mission Statement

> _“Guiding Anglia is dedicated to enabling girls and young women develop their potential and to make a difference in the world. We offer girls and young women a space where they can be themselves, have fun, build friendships, gain valuable life skills and make a positive difference to their communities.”_

## Values

Girlguiding’s values are our shared commitment to be:

- Caring
- Challenging
- Empowering
- Fun
- Inclusive
- Inspiring

In line with these values, Hertfordshire County also recognise the importance of a strong county team demonstrating to all members how working together, sharing ideas, utilising skill sets and sharing the load will promote a healthy, friendly, supportive and loyal approach to guiding.

As such, our strategy has been formed by bringing together advisors, and commissioners from across the county. The document contains a detailed plan of action which will form roadmaps for each team within the County Operations Group to own and work towards. The Trustees will ensure that Divisions, Districts and units are updated and involved in the developments and opportunities.

## Themes

Along with continuing the “Being our Best” themes of Excellence, Voice, Access and Capacity;

Girlguiding has just released its Strategy for 2020 at the time of writing and focuses on three themes within its strategy. These themes are reflected within our county strategy.
