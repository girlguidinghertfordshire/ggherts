### Joint Inspire coordination lead volunteer

Hi, I’m Erin and I'm so excited to share a bit about myself and my new role as the joint Inspire coordination lead volunteer for Girlguiding Hertfordshire.

For as long as I can remember, Girlguiding has been a constant in my life. I started my journey as a Rainbow, progressing through the sections to become a Brownie, Guide, and Ranger. Today, I'm proud to be an adult leader for Brownies in Sawbridgeworth, in East Hertfordshire division.

My journey with Girlguiding has been deeply influenced by my late mother, a remarkable woman who was a Brownie leader and was awarded the Anglia Brooch for her bravery in continuing her role despite battling cancer. Her dedication to Girlguiding and her unwavering spirit continue to inspire me.

Girlguiding has always been about more than just badges and camps for me. It's a place where I've found friendship, support, and a sense of belonging. It's a place where I can be myself, learn new skills, and make a difference.

Now, as I embark on this new role, I'm eager to inspire young women aged 18-30 to embrace the opportunities and experiences that Girlguiding offers. I believe that everyone deserves to have a community where they feel valued and empowered and I am passionate about fostering these within an inclusive environment. By incorporating events that celebrate diverse religions, faiths, and disabilities, we can create a more compassionate and understanding Girlguiding community. I believe that embracing our differences enriches our experiences and helps us grow as individuals. As a lover of theatre and musical theatre, I'm keen to introduce creative and expressive elements into our events. Additionally, my personal interests in science, sustainability, and the outdoors align with the values of Girlguiding. I'm excited to explore opportunities to combine these passions with our mission of empowering girls. I'm an adventurous spirit, always seeking new challenges and experiences. I can't wait to see the Inspire event calendar filled with a variety of cultural, creative, and outdoor activities that inspire and engage girls of all backgrounds.

I'm particularly excited to work with Amy and Chloe on innovative ideas for the Inspire community. Together, we're committed to creating fun and engaging activities that will inspire and motivate young women. Beyond my role in Girlguiding, I'm passionate about international experiences and cultural exchange. I had the privilege of attending the Essex International Jamboree, where I made lifelong friends from around the world. This experience ignited a passion for travel and cultural exploration.

I volunteered at Pax Lodge, the World Centre for WAGGGS in London where I met incredible young women from diverse backgrounds and formed strong bonds. One such friendship is with Carol from Mexico, who generously gifted me her Mexico Promise badge as a symbol of our friendship and shared values. Visiting all 5 WAGGGS World Centres is my ultimate goal, a journey that will not only expand my horizons but also allow me to contribute to the global sisterhood of Girlguiding. From the vibrant Our Cabaña in Mexico to the serene Our Chalet in Switzerland, each Centre offers a unique cultural experience and the opportunity to connect with girls and young women from all around the world. By immersing myself in different cultures and ways of life, I hope to foster international friendships and strengthen the bonds within the global Girlguiding movement. This adventure will undoubtedly make the world more interconnected, shaping me to be a compassionate and understanding global citizen.

As a passionate advocate for sustainability, I am deeply committed to inspiring young women to take action on climate change. The WAGGGS Climate Change programme, with its focus on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), provides an excellent framework for empowering girls to become environmental leaders. By incorporating these badges into my role as joint Inspire coordination lead volunteer in Girlguiding Hertfordshire, I aim to equip girls with the knowledge and skills to make a positive impact on our planet. Climate change disproportionately affects women and girls, exacerbating existing inequalities. As a female leader in Guiding, I want to advocate for gender-responsive climate action within our movement, ensuring that girls' voices are heard and their needs are prioritised in addressing this global crisis.  

It has been a busy year so far, as this summer I attended Hautbois Fest, where I met many inspirational volunteers from Anglia region. I'm looking forward to collaborating with them on future projects.  

The great opportunities I have mentioned above, have been part of working towards my Queens Guide award, which I am undertaking to expand my skillset and step outside my comfort zone. By tackling new challenges and learning from experienced volunteers, I aim to become a more confident and capable leader. This journey will not only benefit me personally but also allow me to contribute more effectively to my community and inspire young members, like my Brownies, to continue their Girlguiding journey. As a team, we will be promoting the Queens Guide award.

Through difficult times over the years, Girlguiding became a beacon of light, providing a supportive environment and opportunities for personal growth. The unwavering belief in me, from my Girlguiding network, helped me overcome those challenges. Today, I'm proud to be a part of this incredible organisation and eager to make my late mother, and my father, proud by achieving the Queen’s Guide award. In the face of personal challenges, including the loss of my mother and struggles with mental health, Girlguiding has been a constant source of strength and solace. It's a community that understands and supports, offering a safe space to heal and grow.

As I continue my journey with Girlguiding, I'm filled with gratitude for the memories, opportunities and experiences that have shaped me. I'm excited to use my passion and skills to inspire the next generation of young women and girls to know they can do anything.

Thank you for reading.

### Inspire social media volunteer

Hi, I’m Chloe, the county Inspire social media volunteer for Hertfordshire.  

Girlguiding has been a huge, impactful, part of my life since I was 5. It has always made me feel part of something bigger than myself, and somewhere I belong. Now, in my twenties, I can’t wait to make a difference and have new experiences, as part of my new role, as well as being an Inspire member myself.

I started off my Girlguiding journey in Herts, when I joined the Rainbows. I was also a Brownie and Guide before becoming a young leader at my Guide unit. Girlguiding has always been a positive thing in my life, especially during the not so good times. It’s incredibly rewarding and I have always wanted to give back and help others like Girlguiding has helped me. If you can help even one person enjoy guiding and benefit from it, it makes it all worthwhile.

Girlguiding, whether it’s in the unit meeting place or from home, has been a safe and supportive place for me. I wouldn’t be the person I am today without Girlguiding or have met and bonded with friends, who have become sisters to me.  

Girlguiding is an amazing adventure in an inclusive environment where girls are free to be themselves, help them learn and grow and discover their confidence and interests. It doesn’t matter when you join Girlguiding, there are always amazing adventures to have and incredible opportunities to take.

The leadership qualification was something I always wanted to do, so it was the perfect step to take as an adult member. I officially qualified from leader in training to leader last year and am currently an assistant leader at a Rainbow unit. I love volunteering with Rainbows especially as they are beginning their guiding journey. I also volunteer with an all sections unit.

I was part of the Girlguiding Anglia and RSPB group who helped develop the Feel Good in Nature badge.

I hope to complete more youth awards related to Inspire members such as the Queens Guide award in the future.

Outside of Girlguiding, I love to read and even have a blog where I talk about all things to do with authors, books and reading. My favourite books are often from genres such as fantasy, romance and mysteries. This includes books such as The Light That Blinds Us by Andy Darcy Theo and The Three Dahlias by Katy Watson. I’ve also been a Swiftie, ever since I discovered Taylor Swift in her Speak Now era, and specifically the song Enchanted. My other favourite eras include The Tortured Poets Department, Folklore and Reputation.

What I hope to get out of Inspire, as a member of the community as well as the team’s social media volunteer, is to help grow and spread awareness of Inspire within Hertfordshire by producing creative and engaging content for Inspire Hertfordshire’s social media platforms. Making the social media channels a safe inclusive, positive, and supportive environment for all Inspire members.  

I want to help with other areas of Inspire, especially through social media, to encourage members to take part in Inspire activities and opportunities, build their confidence and make friends within the Inspire community.  

There’s so much to come for Inspire and I can’t wait to be a part of it, along with my fellow, amazing team mates, Erin and Amy.
