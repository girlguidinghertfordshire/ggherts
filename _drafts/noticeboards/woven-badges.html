<h3>Queen's Guide Award Badge</h3>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1361 alignleft" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/QGA-300x199.jpg" alt="QGA" width="300" height="199" />A Queen's Guide woven badge is available – this cannot be worn, but can be put on camp blankets etc.</p>
<p>If you would like one please send an email to Mary Du Puy (County Badge Secretary) at <a href="mailto:jmdp@talktalk.net">jmdp@talktalk.net</a> including your:</p>
<p>- Name (and maiden name if applicable)</p>
<p>- Girlguiding Membership Number</p>
<p>- Date you received your Queen's Guide Award</p>
<p>When your details have been checked Mary will ask you to send her a cheque for £1 (made payable to Girlguiding Hertfordshire Badge Account) together with a stamped self-addressed envelope. Please note that this is only for anyone completing their Queen's Guide Award in Hertfordshire (people outside of Hertfordshire are able to order from their own County Badge Secretary).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Woven Long Service Badges</h3>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1865 alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Longservicewovenbadges-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />If you would like a woven long service badge for your camp blanket etc. (not to be worn) they cost £1.50 for each badge required.</p>
<p>If you have a 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 Long Service Brooch and would like a woven badge (or more if you want one to correspond with every brooch) please send the following to Mary Du Puy:</p>
<p>- Your cheque made payable to 'Girlguiding Hertfordshire Badge Account'</p>
<p>- A stamped, self-addressed envelope</p>
<p>- Details of your Girlguiding Membership Number, name of your unit, your telephone number and email address – and please don't forget to state the years for which the badges are required.  Every request has to be checked before badges can be sent out.</p>
<p>If you are ordering for several people then the above information is required for each person, and if you are ordering more than 5 badges then a large stamp is required (76p second class).   Please only request badges for anyone Guiding in Hertfordshire.  These are for years as a Guider/Leader and not years in the Trefoil Guild.</p>
<p>Please <strong>do not</strong> ask for badges unless you have already received the brooch.</p>
<p>Mary will <strong>not</strong> be keeping a stock of these badges, so please let her have your requirements by <strong>31st August</strong> at the latest.   Mary’s address can be found in the County Directory, or from the County Office. If you have any queries email her at <a href="mailto:jmdp@talktalk.net">jmdp@talktalk.net</a></p>
