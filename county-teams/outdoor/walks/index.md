Many town tourist information offices can provide details of local town trails especially at Easter and Christmas. The Walking Team also offers some of their own. There’s a Hertford photo trail and another one from our County Centre in Cottered. Email <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> for a copy. 

Members of the Walking Team will gladly help you organise a walk local to your unit meeting place too.

## Hertford Photo Trail

This also starts and finishes at the Sainsbury’s car park and takes around 1-1 ½ hours depending on how well you know the town. It is suitable for all ages and is mostly flat with a couple of steps up to bridges that cross the river into the Castle Gardens.  

Email <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> for a copy of the trail.
