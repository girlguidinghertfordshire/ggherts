On this page you will find some information and some lovely trails and walks you may like to do, but please refrain from visiting walks outside of your local area and always abide with social distancing.

As a team we have many routes and types of walks that we have undertaken across the county.  We are happy to supply these upon request. Two examples given by Alison Tuch our Walking Team Adviser: 

## Canal walk from Hertford to Ware
**Distance:** 8km or 5miles
**Park** at Hartham Common. The Sainsbury's car park is free for 3 hours _if you spend £10_ or you can use the council car parks. 

Cross the Sainsbury's car park towards the SE corner and follow the riverside footpath for 100m to an open body of water where the canal starts. Walk towards The Old Barge pub and past some lovely old cottages besides the canal. 

On the Hertford & Bishop's Stortford OS map, the grid reference for the start of the canal is TL 32601275.

You can follow the towpath as far, or as little as you like... even all the way into London. A nice easy walk however is to stop in Ware for coffee and return the same way on the towpath. (The return walk is 8km or 5miles) You'll pass Hertford Lock, lots of canal boats and river birds. (Note: It is possible to return on the opposite side of the canal but it's a little tricky in places so using a map is recommended if you wish to try this). 

## Hertford Photo Trail
This also starts and finishes at the Sainsbury’s car park and takes around 1-1 ½ hours depending on how well you know the town. It is suitable for all ages and is mostly flat with a couple of steps up to bridges that cross the river into the Castle Gardens.
