There are many outdoor training events offered by Girlguiding Hertfordshire:

## Walking

- **Level 1** training covers walks in your local area eg parks, woods and local countryside. Water Safety training helps with this too as our county has many canals, rivers & lakes
- **Level 2** training allows you to take girls into the hills
- **Level 3** training is for mountainous adventures.

See our [Training page](/training/) for details.

Some of our training is shared with other counties in Anglia region or even at national level.
