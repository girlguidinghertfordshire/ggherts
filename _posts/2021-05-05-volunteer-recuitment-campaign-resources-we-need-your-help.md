We need your help to create more resources for our volunteer recruitment campaign!

We know most of our leaders are busy people who juggle busy lives and families - but many potential volunteers think they haven't the time to join us.....

SO this is an opportunity to showcase who we really are - ordinary people who together achieve amazing things!
  
Simply send your name and guiding name, job title, volunteer role(s), an interesting quote about why you volunteer and two photos (one in guiding uniform, one in work attire) to <communications@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>.

Please include a completed photo permission form available to download from the [Share With Us](/get-involved/share/) page.
