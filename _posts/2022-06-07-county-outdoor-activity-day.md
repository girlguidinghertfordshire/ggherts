We need your help to run a County Outdoor Activity Day in September in Cuffley
<!--more-->
## Help required

We are hoping to run another County Outdoor Activity Day on **Sunday 25 September** at Cuffley but in order to do so we need your help!

If you would like to sign up to help out on the day, please do so via the button below. (No special skills are required!)

[Offer of help](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=3yob_CzTykeMNWNnWM6OwZf5T0i4octErRCYrHkhHVhUOUJFSzdZR0swVUdMQkM3UllEM1NSMjJaNi4u){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}{:.btn-gg}

This type of event can only take place if we have enough helpers and registrations of interest to make it viable.
