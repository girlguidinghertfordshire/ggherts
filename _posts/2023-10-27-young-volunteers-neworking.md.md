This informal session, led by our county young leader lead volunteer, is aimed at young leaders and young external volunteers, aged 13 - 18, within the Harpenden and Redbourn division.

A great chance to meet and connect with other young people from your local area.  Share your guiding journey so far, and if you are undertaking your young leader qualification (YLQ) share your experience or ask any questions you may have.

The perfect setting to find out more about resources, opportunities and the support network available to you.

Refreshments provided.

Please wear your uniform, if you have one, and if you are undertaking the YLQ, bring your book together with any supporting evidence.
