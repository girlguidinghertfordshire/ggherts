Working together - we are making a REAL difference to how many people actually see our recruitment posts across social media. Here’s how you can help make the campaign even MORE effective in your own district! Just three simple steps...

1. Encourage all your leaders, young leaders and parents to follow the [Girlguiding Hertfordshire Facebook][1]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} page  where we are sharing 2 to 3 recruitment posts per week
2. Share these posts to your local community Facebook groups, parent WhatsApp groups and to friends and colleagues. Talk about why you love guiding!
3. Ask all leaders, young leaders and parents to like and comment on these posts – this will give a positive impression about guiding locally, and more importantly it will mean the post actually reaches more people!
