If you are planning on hiring and driving a small bus or minibus, as well as Girlguiding’s requirement of a [Small Bus Permit](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/information-for-volunteers/programme-and-activities/guidance-on-activities/transport/coaches-and-minibuses/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} it is important to check whether the company you are hiring the vehicle from has any other requirements you need to fulfil, for example, holding the [Minibus Driver Awareness Scheme (MIDAS) qualification](https://ctauk.org/training/midas/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} (administered by the Community Transport Association) or a Hertfordshire County Council minibus permit.

Currently, Hertfordshire County Council are in the process of relaunching their Minibus Permit Scheme.  They have advised that, at present, anyone with an HCC minibus permit that has expired or is due to expire will be granted an extension.

Some of the changes to their Scheme that have taken place are:

- Assessments will be carried out by fully qualified HCC staff not independent assessors.
- Minibus and passenger assessments will be valid for 3 years
- Minibus and passenger assessment fees have been standardised
- Minibus and passenger assessment permits will be sent electronically by email (excluding Section 19 permits)
- A fee of £11 will apply to Section 19 permits
- On completion of a D1 qualification, an assessment will be required within the first 6 months of driving a minibus.

Full details of the Hertfordshire County Council Minibus Permit Scheme will be available to view on their website once the Scheme relaunch is complete.
