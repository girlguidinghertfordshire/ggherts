<p>We are delighted to announce that Verity Maclachlan has been awarded a Laurel.</p>
<p>Verity has been involved in Girlguiding and Girl Scouts for many years and has committed over 24 years to 1st Radlett Guides and Radlett district. We are also very fortunate to have her on the county team.</p>
<p>As a trained nurse, she has used her skills and training qualification to teach hundreds of leaders and girls First Response and Heartstart courses. She works in collaboration with St John Ambulance and British Heart Foundation and not only teaches others but is frequently the designated first aider at events all over the county and even at events abroad.</p>
<p>Verity and her family have travelled a lot with Scottâ€™s work and they have a love of the outdoors, enjoying walking and skiing. These are passions that Verity has inspired others to enjoy by joining international teams to Sweden, Switzerland, Uganda and Scotland and getting involved in the walking teams at county and region, as well as events such as Three Peaks and Great Patrol Hunt.</p>
<p>Verity has devoted so much of her life to others, through her work, her family and her guiding. But she has also fundraised for and joined service projects in Uganda and she and Scott have supported a Ugandan man and his family and now treat them as an extension of their own family.</p>
<p>Verity demonstrates everything that the Laurel award stands for and more. She is selfless and inspiring and we, in Girlguiding Hertfordshire are so pleased that she has been recognised by Girlguiding at a national level and awarded with the very prestigious and very much deserved Laurel award.</p>
<p>Well done Verity!</p>
