Many of you will now be taking a well-earned break over the summer holiday but as we come out of
lockdown from the 19th of July, we wanted to remind you that face-to-face training will now be
offered in meetings rooms or venues which are normally used for guiding activities when we return.
Any training event will be following the current Government Guidelines for Covid Secure areas.

Please do visit the [events section](/events/) to check what training sessions are coming up
and if you can’t find a course that you are looking for, please do get in contact
with the County Guiding Development Adviser: [guidingdev@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk](mailto:guidingdev@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk) or your
District / Division Commissioner to discuss a potential training that you may need to support you in
your development.

We are currently looking at Food Hygiene when going on residentials, support for Young Leaders in
training, assisting leaders who have girls starting their Duke of Edinburgh awards through guiding, to
mention just a couple, so please do get in contact so that we can investigate how we can help
develop you.

All training logged whether it be online training, e-learning or Face to Face since January 2021 will
also go towards you claiming your [training pin badges.](/training-badges) A BIG “Thank You” for the time that you put
into training. Please complete the training records and either send to your District / Division
Commissioner or the County Guiding Development Adviser:
[guidingdev@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk](mailto:guidingdev@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk)

**Reminder:** If you have completed your First Response face to face training and e-learning since
January 2021, please contact your District Commissioner to collect your [First Response badges.](/1st-response-badges/)

Have a great summer and we look forward to seeing you in training in the coming months.
