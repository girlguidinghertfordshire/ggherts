We are looking for creative and passionate individuals to join the new county growth and retention team.

The team will work together to generate ideas on how to grow guiding in Hertfordshire county,
and the best way to share them to reach the widest audience.

Team meetings will take place approximately once a term, mostly online, but some face to face.

If you would like to know more or want to be part of this new team please email <volunteer@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>.
