One of our young members, who is currently undertaking her Queen's Guide award, is looking to start an online cooking club for Guides and Rangers aged 14+.

The classes are aimed at those who would like to learn to cook, or simply have some fun.

The 12 week programme would take place each **Saturday** from **5.45pm - 7.15pm** via **Zoom**, and you would work through cheap and easy recipes, which could be printed off and used in the future for example, at university or cooking for family/friends.  

If you would be interested in taking part in these classes please complete the online survey to gauge level of interest: <https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/7VPVQCM>{:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}
