## We need your help

We are looking for volunteers to take part in our **'meet the volunteer'** recruitment campaign.

Previously we have feature some of our wonderful leaders but to showcase the wider variety of volunteer opportunities available within the county this time we are looking for more varied roles.

## Could this be you?

This is your opportunity to showcase who we really are - ordinary people who together achieve amazing things.

Simply send your name, volunteer role and photo, plus your job role and photo, with an interesting quote about why you volunteer and what you enjoy to <communications@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>

Please include a completed photo permission form available to download from the [volunteers' resources page](/about-us/resources/)
