After the success of previous years, we are looking for adult volunteers who would be interested in attending Trooping the Colour and leading a small group of young members*.

This year's events are taking place on **Saturday 7 June** and **Saturday 14 June**

As guests of Herts Youth United you will have prime view of the proceedings from the Horse Guards' junction with The Mall within the Uniformed Youth Groups secure enclosure.

**Closing date** Tuesday 11 March

*Once the number of adult spaces have been finalised we will advertise young members spaces so keep a look out.
