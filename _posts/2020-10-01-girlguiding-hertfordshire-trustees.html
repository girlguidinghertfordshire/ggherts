<p>Following a strategic review in April 2020, the county Trustees consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The County Commissioner (1)</li>
<li>The Division Commissioners (10 people, 9 votes)</li>
</ul>
<p>voted to appoint further Trustees to the county.  This is to ensure key elements of the strategy are considered at Trustee meetings.</p>
<p>Therefore the following roles were added as Trustees:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Assistant County Commissioners (4)</li>
<li>The County Treasurer (1)</li>
<li>The County Guiding Development Adviser (1)</li>
<li>The County Membership Co-ordinator (1)</li>
<li>The County Property Adviser (currently incorporated as ACC role)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Constitution was amended as such, authorised by Anglia’s Region Chief Commissioner on 4th July 2020 and the Charity Commission updated.</p>
