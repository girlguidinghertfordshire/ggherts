**Safer guiding** is Girlguiding’s safeguarding training and replaces a safe space levels 1-3.  

This training will help volunteers understand their part in safeguarding and enable them to provide girls with a safe space to learn, develop and have fun.

There are 2 types of safer guiding training:

- Safer guiding and  
- Safer guiding basics.

Volunteers who have any contact with girls will need to complete the **safer guiding course.** This has 4 topics and replaces a safe space levels 1, 2 and 3.  

Volunteers with non-girl facing roles will need to complete the **safer guiding basics course.** This is a shorter version of the safer guiding training.

The safer guiding training will need to be renewed every 3 years.

Find out more about the 2 training courses, which applies to your role, and when you need to complete it on the [safer guiding training webpage](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/information-for-volunteers/learning-and-development/safer-guiding/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} of the Girlguiding UK website’s.
