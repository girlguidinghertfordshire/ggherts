**Safer guiding** is Girlguiding’s safeguarding training and replaces a safe space levels 1-3.  

This training will help volunteers understand their part in safeguarding and enable them to provide girls with a safe space to learn, develop and have fun.

There are 2 types of safer guiding training:

- Safer guiding and  
- Safer guiding basics.

Volunteers who have any contact with girls will need to complete the **safer guiding course.** This has 4 topics and replaces a safe space levels 1, 2 and 3. Each of the 4 sections is followed by an end of topic quiz. All 4 must be passed to complete the course and you have 3 attempts at each. If after 3 attempts you have not passed the quiz that section will be locked. You should continued to work through the training and complete all 4 sections.

After completing the training, if you failed 1 of the quizzes you must let your commissioner know and they will arrange for a safer guiding qualified trainer to contact you to discuss the specific topic.

If you failed 2 or more of the quizzes you will need to attend either a webinar or a face-to-face session, both of which can be booked on the [learning platform.](https://learning.girlguiding.org.uk/login){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}

Volunteers with non-girl facing roles will need to complete the **safer guiding basics course.** This is a shorter version of the safer guiding training.

The safer guiding training will need to be renewed every 3 years.

Find out more about the 2 training courses, which applies to your role, and when you need to complete it on the [safer guiding training webpage](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/information-for-volunteers/learning-and-development/safer-guiding/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} of the Girlguiding UK website’s.

Both safeguarding training courses are accessible via the [learning platform.](https://learning.girlguiding.org.uk/login/index.php){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}

## A safe space level 4

Anyone that needs a safe space level 4 for their role can continue to complete this training via the [learning platform.](https://learning.girlguiding.org.uk/login/index.php){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} This process has not changed and will be reviewed in 2025.

Anyone starting a commissioner role needs to complete their level 4 before their term starts.

## A safe space for under 18s
