Starting on Monday 8th May there will be opportunities for everyone to join in. No matter what you are good at, there’ll be something to suit helping hands of all shapes and sizes! Plan an event in your area.

Girlguiding is taking part in the Big Help Out to mark His Majesty The King’s Coronation when thousands of organisations across the country are getting together to give us all the chance to help out in our own local communities.

## Organise an event for your unit, district or division

Here's some examples of events you could organise. Email <events@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> with your ideas of events that can be run.

### Working parties

Does your hut or meeting place need a spring clean, a fresh lick of paint or the garden need some work. Organise a working party to make it happen.

### Cook a meal

Cook a meal and share with your local community, for example, for the elderly or people living alone.

### Thank you tea

Hold a thank you tea for your local volunteers.

### Food bank donations

Provide a drop-off location for local food banks.

### Mini open day

Hold a mini open day and run a couple of activities.
