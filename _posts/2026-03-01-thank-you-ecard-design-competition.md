Help us say thank you to our wonderful adult volunteers for all they do, whether it's working with young members directly, or providing support to other volunteers.

We are again looking to our Rainbows, Brownies, Guides, Rangers and young leaders to design this year's thank you e-card.

![E-card design instructions](/assets/images/2026/02/ecard-design-instructions.webp){:.d-block.mx-auto.ms-3.mb-3}

The winning entry will be selected by the county commissioner team and the county's thank you e-card will be sent out during Volunteers' Week; the first week of June.

Download the card template via the button below and create your design, which must fit within the square. No wording should be included in the design.

This can be done together as a unit activity, or completed at home by our young members in their own time.

Email entries to <admin@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> by **Sunday 3 May.**
