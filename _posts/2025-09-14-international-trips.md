## Sangam, India – Girlguiding Hertfordshire county trip

{:.slider.w-md-75}

16 Rangers and young leaders supported by 4 adult leaders took part in an adventure to India this summer. The group stayed in Sangam at one of the Guiding World Centres and also spent time exploring Delhi and Agra.

Whilst staying at Sangam they took part in the welcome ceremony and a centre tour, as well as exploring the local town of Pune via tuk tuks. As part of the Brave Space II project at Sangam, they met up with community partner organisations such as the Muslim Orphanage for Girls, ultimately developing leadership skills to take back to their units in the UK. Their time in Sangam ended with an Indian international evening where the girls wore tailored traditional clothing, learnt to tie saris and joined in the traditional meal and dancing.  

The group then travelled to Agra, where one of the highlights included a sunrise trip to the Taj Mahal! They also enjoyed a visit to the Elephant Care and Conservation Centre, to meet and learn about elephants who have been rescued from cruelty in captivity. One final treat was a visit to the flight deck on the journey home, before being reunited with their families and saying farewell to one another.  

Leila, one of the young people on the trip, said “on the flight home, some of the girls and the leaders got to talking with a flight attendant who used to be a Guide! She gave us extra snacks and let us all go in the cockpit after we landed.”

Several of our members were selected to attend Girlguiding Anglia’s trip to Morocco this summer, joining a total of 11 young people and 4 leaders.

Kate, a young leader from 7th Chorleywood Brownies attended this trip as her first Girlguiding international and said “I had so much fun, learnt a lot about Morocco and definitely met some great new friends.”

Janet and Anne from South East Hertfordshire attended the experience as leaders. Janet said “It was a privilege to be part of the team & watch the young members grow in confidence, gain new experiences and make memories.”

One of the highlights of the trip was hiking in the Atlas Mountains, passing by waterfalls and learning about the natural oils and products made in Morocco. One evening they even went camel riding and saw a fire show! The trip allowed everyone to embrace the Moroccan culture, with a traditional cookery lesson to make tagine and various tours of historic palaces, gardens and mosques.

Leaders Nicola, Katherine, Flora and Beverly kept the destination a secret from both the girls and their parents until their arrival at St Pancras Station.

During their trip, the girls participated in a waffle-making workshop, enjoyed an open-top bus tour of the city, explored Mini Europe amusement park, and concluded their adventure with a tour, demonstration, and tasting at a chocolate museum.
