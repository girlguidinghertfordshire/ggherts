Did your unit enjoy completing the Girls Golf challenge badge, or do you just fancy including something new in your summer programme?

In conjunction with Hertfordshire Golf we are excited to offer Rainbows, Brownies, Guides, Rangers and young leaders the opportunity to attend an evening of golfing activities and games.

There are 4 dates and locations to choose from. All events are taking place 5.30pm - 7.30pm, as follows:

- **Tuesday 3 June:** Essendon Golf Club, Hatfield (bookings close 9am Thurs 22 May)
- **Wednesday 4 June:** The Hertfordshire Golf and Country Club, Broxbourne (bookings close 9am Thurs 22 May)
- **Wednesday 11 June:** Chesfield Down Golf and Country Club, Hitchin (bookings close 9am Wed 4 June)
- **Wednesday 18 June:** Berkhamsted Golf Club, Berkhamsted (bookings close 9am Wed 11 June)

Designed to be a unit activity, either as a standalone event, or as part of the county Girls Golf challenge badge, this introduces girls to Golf whilst providing an evening of fun and learning new skills.

Leaders can purchase the [Girls Golf badge](/get-involved/challenge-badges/#girls-golf-challenge-badge) should they wish to.

There are 50 girl spaces available on each date, on a first come, first served basis. Bookings will close on the booking deadline dates (or sooner if spaces sell out).

**Leaders go free; please DO NOT book 'tickets' for leaders** but you must ensure you meet the usual Girlguiding outdoor ratios.

The cost is **Â£2.50 per girl** (includes refreshments). BACS payment in advance to bank account details and payment reference as set out on the Eventbrite booking system.

Information and consent forms will be required for this activity and can be downloaded via the buttons below. Units will need to arrange for their own home emergency contact and transportation.

Uniform and sensible shoes should be worn.
