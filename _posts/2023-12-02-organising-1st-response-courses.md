If you are looking to arrange a 1st response course for your district or division, either a 1 x 6 hour full day training or a 2 x 3 hour training, please follow the procedure as set out below.

Please note that from **1 September 2024** the training organiser, i.e. the person requesting the training, will be responsible for collecting the £20 per person fee from those booked on to the training course (this fee is non refundable) as well as providing a receipt.

1. Training organiser to contact the county training administration lead volunteer a minimum of **3 months** before the training is required by completing the online booking form.
2. Before completing the online booking form, ensure you have a date (or dates if over two nights, both nights must be attended) and a venue address.
3. Confirmation of who the training is booked with will be given to the training organiser, along with a reference number, once confirmed.
4. Confirmation of where to send the total payment to will be provided to the training organiser when the trainer details are provided, as this will depend on whether an internal or external trainer has been secured.
5. **8 weeks** prior to the training the following details need to be supplied to the county administration lead volunteer, via the online training attendees’ details form:
    1. Full name of volunteers attending
    2. GO numbers for each volunteer
    3. Division / district
    4. Confirmation that attendees have been advised that the mandatory 1st response elearning element of this training must be completed via the learning platform and showing on their GO record **before** the external first aid/1st response course can be added to their GO record.
6. When the training course has taken place, the trainer must send a list confirming who completed the course to the county admin team via <admin@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> who will update each attendees GO record when the elearning element has been completed.

## Please note the following important details

1. A minimum of 12 attendees is required. County can advertise your training to other members in the county, with bookings available via Eventbrite, if you are unable to reach these numbers. **Once a training is advertised on Eventbrite all bookings must be made via the Eventbrite system.**
2. Members from other counties can book on to a training course if there are still spaces available in the 2 weeks leading up to the course date.
3. Cost per attendee is £20 to be collected by the training organiser.
4. Training organiser to provide a receipt for each payment, which can be by way of an email acknowledging receipt, and should include the following information:  
  a) name and date of the course  
  b) amount received  
  c) payment method e.g. cheque or bank transfer  
  d) name of person(s) payment covers  
5. Cost of venue (if applicable i.e., division or district are not covering this out of funds) will be paid by Girlguiding Hertfordshire on production of an invoice, emailed to the county treasurer on <ctreasurer@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>) after the training event. The cost of this will be covered by the attendees attending.
