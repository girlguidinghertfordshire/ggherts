<p class="x_MsoNormal">As face to face trainings are still prohibited by Girlguiding UK we would like to offer the opportunity to you to access training through e-learning. As a reminder, there are lots of opportunities on the <a href="https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/resources/resource-library/e-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Girlguiding UK websiteÂ </a></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">If there is an alternative training that you would like to access that may require payment then we would like to support you in your development. This may be food hygiene or looking after girls with autism or anything else that enhances your role in guiding or will benefit the girls in your care. If this is you, please contact county Guiding Development Adviser: <a href="mailto:guidingdev@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk">guidingdev@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk</a> with your name, membership number, course details and cost and how it will benefit you or the girls in guiding and consideration will be made to funding or part funding the course.</p>
