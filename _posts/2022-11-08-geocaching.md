Did you know a member of the county's Walking Team can come out to you and lead Geocaching for your unit?  

Geocaching is a treasure hunt that uses coordinates to direct you to hidden containers called caches.

Whether you wish to help your Guides undertake their Geocaching interest badge, or just want to have a fun event and learn a new skill with your unit, whatever section or age, please contact <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> to arrange a session.
