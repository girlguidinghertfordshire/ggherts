After the success of previous years, we are looking for adult volunteers who would be interested in attending Trooping the Colour and leading a small group of young members.

This year's events are taking place on Saturday 6 June (The Colonels Review) and Saturday 13 June (The King's Birthday Parade).

[Register your interest](https://forms.office.com/e/2s1FEwCgLF?origin=lprLink){:.external-link.btn.btn-primary}{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}

**Closing date 28 February.**

As guests of Herts Youth United you will have prime view of the proceedings from the Horse Guards' junction with The Mall within the Uniformed Youth Groups secure enclosure.

Due to limited spaces, we kindly ask that anyone who has previously attended this event with Girlguiding Hertfordshire does not apply, to allow others the opportunity to take part. Places for both dates will be allocated at random using an online selection tool. Please ensure that all leaders and young members attending have the appropriate photo permissions in place for the day.

Once the number of adult spaces have been finalised we will advertise young members spaces so keep a look out.
