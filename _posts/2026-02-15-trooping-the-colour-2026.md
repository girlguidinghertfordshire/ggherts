Dating back to the 17th century, this spectacular military display of precision and pageantry marks the King's official birthday.

Girlguiding Hertfordshire are pleased to again be able to offer limited spaces to some of our young members, as guests of Herts Youth United, within the Uniformed Youth Groups secure enclosure, which offers prime views of the proceedings from the Horse Guards’ junction with The Mall.

Do you know a Brownie, Guide, Ranger or a young leader who would like to attend this year's Trooping the Colour?

A total of 6 Girlguiding Hertfordshire young members will be selected:
