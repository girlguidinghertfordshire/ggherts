Please ensure any expenses to be claimed directly from the county treasurer (this includes county/division commissioners and trainers) incurred during 2023 but not yet claimed for, are submitted by **Friday 15 December** via email to <ctreasurer@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>, so they can be paid before 31 December.

Any difficulties meeting this deadline please email the county treasurer with details.

There is no guarantee that expenses for 2023 not claimed by 15 December will be paid if we do not hear from you.
