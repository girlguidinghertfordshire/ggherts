From 2027 there will no longer be a subscription fee for volunteers, so it's time to start thinking about your unit subscriptions for next year.

Girlguiding aims to keep the level of income the same, and from next year unit invoice totals will be based solely on the number of young members. Therefore annual subscriptions will look higher per young member.

To help with budgeting, Girlguiding have produced a helpful, Excel based, budgeting tool for you to use.
