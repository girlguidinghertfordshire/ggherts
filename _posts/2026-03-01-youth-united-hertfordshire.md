Girlguiding Hertfordshire is proud to be part of Youth United Hertfordshire.

An initiative, led by the Lord-Lieutenant of Hertfordshire, Robert Voss CBE CStJ, that brings together the senior leaders from 8 uniformed youth groups across the county of Hertfordshire.

Girlguiding Hertfordshire and Scouts Hertfordshire, Air, Army, Fire, Sea and Volunteer Police Cadets, as well as St John Ambulance are offered opportunities, as members of Youth United Hertfordshire, such as attending Trooping the Colour.

As well as providing young people with the opportunity to take part in a wide and varied range of activities and events, the aim is also to support volunteers from each of the organisations through communication and sharing best practice.
