We have been informed by Anglia that there is an opportunity for a Welcome event for Young External Volunteers

Girlguiding are offering two welcome events for Young External Volunteers that have recently joined us. Any volunteer who has enquired or become a member in the last couple of months has been sent an e-mail and been invited to attend one of two events. They are open to any member across the UK. There are currently about 90 spaces available out of 200 but only 3 members from Anglia region have booked at the moment.   If you have any questions please contact Cassie Newbery on <a href="mailto:CassieN@girlguiding-anglia.org.uk">CassieN@girlguiding-anglia.org.uk</a>.

These events are virtual (by Zoom) details once you have applied with parental consent.  To do so please contact <a href="mailto:CassieN@girlguiding-anglia.org.uk">Cassie</a> at Anglia HQ who can help you.

The events are planned for :

- <strong>Saturday 3rd July, 11am - 12:30pm or</strong>
- <strong>Monday 5th July, 5pm - 7:30pm</strong>

This will give all new people an opportunity to settle into their new leadership role, learn about Girlguiding, explore all the many activities units do, support the planning of your personal goals for your DofE or even goals just for yourself in your role and meet other new young volunteers.
