As a “thank you” for the time you give up, we invite you to log the hours of training and personal development you complete for Girlguiding and claim an owl pin badge when you reach each milestone.

You can download the log sheet below:

## Claiming your limited-edition Owl training badges

Keep a record of your time spent on [training*](#backdate "Training can be backdated to January 2021"), either in person, online or on the learning platform. Whether this is a mandatory first aid or safer guiding course, additional training to enhance your skills or becoming an expert in a given area.

Each time you reach 10 hours (up to a maximum of 40), claim your owl badge from your division or district commissioner.

We thank you for the time you have given to train for your Girlguiding role(s).
