As a "thank you" for the time you put into training, we invite you to log the hours of training you complete and claim a pin badge when you reach milestones.

You can download the log sheet training record below:

## Claiming your limited-edition Owl training badges

Keep a record of your time spent on [training*](#backdate "Training can be backdated to January 2021"), both in person and online.  Each time you have reached ten hours (up to 40), claim your Owl badge from your division/district commissioner.

These badges were purchased with money donated to us by Anglia region to support and encourage training of our volunteers.

Thank you for the time you have invested in training.
