## Claiming your limited-edition Owl Training badges

Keep a record of your time spent on <a href="#backdate" title="Training can be backdated to January 2021">training*</a>, both in person and on-line.  Each time you have reached ten hours (up to 40), claim your Owl badge from your District Commissioner or County Trainer.

These badges were purchased with money donated to us by Anglia Region to support and encourage training of our volunteers.  When they are gone, they are gone!

Thank you for the time you have invested in training.
