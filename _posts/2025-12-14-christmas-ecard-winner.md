A big well done to Amelie, aged 5, a Rainbow with 3rd Radlett Rainbows, whose colourful and cute reindeer design was chosen as the winner of our 2025 county Christmas ecard design competition.

Amelie's design formed the basis of this year's county Christmas ecard, which was circulated to all our members aged 14+, who have opted into receiving marketing.

We hope you all agree what a lovely festive image Amelie has created.

Wishing all our members a merry Christmas and happy New Year.
