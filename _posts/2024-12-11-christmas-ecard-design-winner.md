Congratulations to Rakshanti from 5th St Albans Guide, who is this year's winner of our Christmas ecard design competition.

Her fantastic watercolour has been chosen as the winner of our county Christmas ecard competition.

Rakshanti submitted 2 outstanding entries, both of which showed her impressive creativity and love for painting, with this winning design also incorporating Girlguiding elements, as well as the magic of the Christmas tree scene.

This year saw a vast amount of entries and showcased how many talented artists we have within our younger county members.

The county Christmas ecard will be circulated to our members aged 14+, who have opted into receiving marketing.

Wishing everyone a very happy Christmas and New Year.
