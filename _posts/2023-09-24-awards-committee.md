We are seeking new members, at any level, who would like to join the Hertfordshire awards committee.

You will be required to attend a few meetings a year (no more than 3 and mainly virtually) as well as attendance at the annual county awards event.

As new committee members you would help review the nominations and make recommendations as to which awards would be suitable.

If you are interested in joining the committee please get in touch via <awards@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>
