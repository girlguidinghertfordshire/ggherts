![Verity Maclachlan, MBE](/assets/images/2024/06/verity-maclachlan.webp){:.float-end.ms-3.mb-3}Congratulations to Verity Maclachlan from Radlett who has been recognised for her outstanding volunteer work in His Majesty the King’s 2024 Birthday Honours list.

Verity Maclachlan, Leader of 1st Radlett Rangers and Anglia trainer was awarded an MBE, by His Majesty the King in honour of her services to young people.

Verity first joined Girlguiding as a Brownie in Derbyshire aged 9. In 1984 she became a volunteer in Banchory, Scotland. However, Verity has spent most of the past 40 years as a Guide and Ranger leader in Radlett, giving girls a space to be themselves, have fun and try new things through the opportunities offered through Girlguiding’s programme of badges and activities.

Alongside this, Verity has used her interest in first aid and experience as a cardiac nurse to benefit her local community. Verity provides first aid training across the Girlguiding Anglia region and has helped to install defibrillators in her local area. Verity said: *“As a cardiac nurse I’ve seen too many situations where friends or family didn’t know how to help someone who had collapsed. I train school groups, Guides and other youth groups so that they know how to deal with a cardiac arrest.”*

During her time volunteering, she has had various roles, aside from being a unit leader, such as: Anglia walking advisor, Baden Powell award coordinator and county camp advisor. Verity said: *“Receiving this award fills me with immense pride. I've had the privilege of working with so many incredible young women and girls throughout the years. My finest memories stem from walking trips and international trips with Girlguiding, since I particularly enjoy introducing people to the outdoors.”*
