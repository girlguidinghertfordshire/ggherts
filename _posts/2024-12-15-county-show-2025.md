We are looking for volunteers to help at next year's Hertfordshire County Show, taking place on Saturday 24 - Sunday 25 May.

This is the county's flagship event which celebrates all things country: living, food and farming.

With over 35,000 visitors each year, this is the place to be!

Helpers of all ages welcome.

If you are interested, please email <volunteer@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>
