Are you presently, or considering becoming, a young leader and aged 13 - 18 or a young external volunteer?

Our county young leader lead volunteer is in the process of organising division events designed to connect likeminded young people, offering support, resources and information about opportunities available in a informal setting.  

This will extend to assistance with the young leader qualification (YLQ) at all stages of completion.

Come along and get to know others, share your experiences and find the answers to any questions you may have.

If this sounds like something you are interested in taking part in register your interest via the online form.
