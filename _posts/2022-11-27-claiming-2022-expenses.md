Please ensure any expenses claimed directly from the County Treasurer, Elaine Wilson, (this includes county/division commissioners and trainers) incurred during 2022 but not yet claimed for, are submitted by 15 December 2022 via email to <ctreasurer@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> so they can be paid before 31 December.

Any difficulties meeting this deadline please email Elaine with details.  

There is no guarantee expenses for 2022 not claimed by 15 December will be paid if we do not hear from you.
