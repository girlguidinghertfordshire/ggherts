- Girlguiding Hertfordshire is subsidising this by £3.00 per member to ensure we can keep our subscription as low as possible.
- Your division and/or district may have added their own levy on top of this.  Please speak to your local commissioner for details.
- Financial support is available via the online county grant form. Grant applications should be submitted by Friday 10 January.
