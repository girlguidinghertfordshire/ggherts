Congratulations to Mia A. of 1st Great Ashby Guides, the winner of the county's first thank you ecard design competition for Volunteers' Week.

Mia shows great artistic talent, and her incredible jellyfish design was chosen by the judges based upon its creativity, as well as the symbolic meaning of this elegant marine creature; often associated as spiritual guides and considered resilient, lucky, and adaptable. Traits we see in our volunteers, so the perfect design for this competition!

Mia's design will form the basis of the ecard which will be sent out to our adult volunteers today (4th June).

Thank you to all those who took the time to enter, we loved the variety of designs.

Thanks to all our volunteers for everything they do for guiding!
