Are you a Ranger or young leader, or do you know any, who would be interested in getting involved in our county media and communications team?

The team are looking for individuals, preferably aged 14-18, who are interested in and would like to get involved in taking photos at county events, creating graphics or writing stories from within their division or district.

Help spread the successes and good news stories within Girlguiding Hertfordshire.

If you, or someone you know would be interested in this opportunity please contact the county media and communications lead volunteer via <communications@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>.
