Herts Pride, Hertfordshire's biggest LGBTQ+ festival, takes place this year on Saturday 19 August 2023 at Cassiobury Park in Watford.

Girlguiding's presence at these exciting events reinforces the message that we are for all girls, inclusive and proud to support out LGBTQ+ members.

Following last year's success we are looking for 1 or 2 people to lead the team on the day as well as people to help out on our stand.   You can volunteer for early or late sessions or all day.

If you can spare some time and would like to attend this event and help represent Girlguiding please complete the online form by Friday 19 May to register to volunteer.
