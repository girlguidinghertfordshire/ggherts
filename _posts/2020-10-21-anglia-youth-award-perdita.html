<p>We are delighted to announce that Perdi has been awarded an Anglia Youth award.</p>
<p>Some of you will know that Girlguiding has made a commitment to the environment, in particular through our “Plastic Promise”. Perdi has embraced this commitment by creating activities using natural resources at a camp she supported. She has a passion for making a change and has been involved in many projects to make a change, such as a trip to Uganda and a Toilet Twinning scheme with her school.</p>
<p>Perdi is the making of an amazing leader as she involves everyone, even the most shy; shows enthusiasm at every opportunity and inspires so many young people and leaders alike with her infectious passion and commitment.</p>
<p>I personally would like to thank Perdi for the amazing work she has done already and look forward to seeing what else she chooses to get involved in! Well done Perdi.</p>
