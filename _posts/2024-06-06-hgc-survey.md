We need your views!

Hertfordshire Guide Centre has been the county headquarters since 1996 but the time has come to give it a new lease of life, bringing it up to date and ensuring that it is accessible and inclusive for everyone; creating an environmentally friendly building we can be all be proud of.

Now the [refurbishment fundraising campaign](/about-us/county-centre/fundraising/) is under way, we would value your insight into the considerations you make when looking to take your members away indoors overnight, as well as your thoughts on the proposed changes and whether these will encourage you to visit the venue more in the future.

Please take a few moments of your time to complete the below survey.

[Complete survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=3yob_CzTykeMNWNnWM6OwZj-g9JL5lpMiAybQMCV5zxURDM5T1dVNzVaQjVaOEhPMkZGUzU2WDBJSy4u){:.btn.btn-primary.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}

Closing date **28 June.**
