Girlguiding Hertfordshire is providing volunteers to help at the County Show.

## Ticket Scanning

We need volunteers to help cover the ticket scanning at the main gates of the show. Therefore we require volunteers to be aged 16 and over. Volunteers are required in two shifts:

- 8.30am to 1pm
- 1pm to 4pm

_There will be more opportunities for younger members to join the fun_
