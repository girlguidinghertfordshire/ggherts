Why not invite the county's First Aid Adviser, Verity Maclachlan, to your Guide or Ranger unit meeting to conduct some first aid and/or CPR training.  

Each session can be adapted to suit your girls and typically lasts 40 minutes. They could also earn the [Lifesaver Challenge badge.][1]

For further information or ideas please contact the county First Aid Adviser [Verity Maclachlan.][2]
