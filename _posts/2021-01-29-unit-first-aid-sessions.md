Why not invite the county's first aid adviser to your Guide or Ranger unit meeting to conduct some first aid and/or CPR training.  

Each session can be adapted to suit your girls and typically lasts 40 minutes. They could also earn the Lifesaver Challenge badge.

For further information or ideas please contact the [county first aid adviser.][2]
