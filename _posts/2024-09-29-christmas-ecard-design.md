We’re looking for Rainbows, Brownies, Guides, Rangers and young leaders to come up with a colourful, festive design to form the basis for this year’s county Christmas ecard.

Your design should:

- Be no bigger than A5 size
- Include "Merry Christmas, Happy Christmas or Seasons Greetings" but no other wording
- Include your first name and unit

The winning design will also be featured on the county website/social media pages.

The county Christmas ecard will be sent to all county members who have opted into receiving marketing communications, from the county commissioner, along with a festive message.

The deadline to send us your designs is midnight Sunday 17 November.

You can send your design by:

- Email (ensuring it is between 1-3mb in size where possible) to <competition@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>, or
- Post (allowing plenty of time for delivery) to ‘Christmas ecard competition’, County Office, c/o Herts Guide Centre, Cottered, Herts SG9 9QP.

By entering the competition, your parent/guardian is consenting to the use of the card image and first name in the ways described in the terms of entry above.
