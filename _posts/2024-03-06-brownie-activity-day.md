Taking place on Saturday 10 May at the Cuffley Activity Learning Centre, here is your chance to get involved in this [county event for Brownies.](/event/Brownie-activity-day)

We are looking for help with arrivals and departures, campfire songs, small craft activities for when girls arrive and are waiting to leave and traffic management.

If you are not attending with your girls but are available and able to help, please e-mail <outdoor@girguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>
