## Who can join

There are lots of reasons for someone to join one of the flexible guiding units. For example:

1. There’s no unit for their age group in their local area
2. They have other commitments, including studies and caring responsibilities which means they can’t attend meetings
3. Transport to and from meetings is a problem
4. An illness or disability which prevents them attending meetings regularly
5. They don’t enjoy spending time in large groups
6. Waiting list for units in your local area

Flexible guiding units means we can offer all the benefits of being a Girlguiding member in a way that fits around your needs and schedule. It’s fun, flexible and full of the same great opportunities. Instead of going to weekly meetings, girls keep in touch through email, text, phone calls, post, working on different activities and badges and meeting up at exciting events.

In Hertfordshire we are now offering flexible guiding units for:

- **Brownies:** <flexiblebrownies@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- **Guides:** <flexibleguides@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- **Rangers:** <flexiblerangers@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

The groups will also gather together for special events and occasions.

Flyers for sections above:

- [Rangers](/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Rangers-Flexible.pdf){:.download-link}{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

We hope to open a flexible guiding unit for **Rainbows** in the future - email <flexibledivision@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} to register your interest.

## How a girl can join

It doesn’t matter if there’s no specific flexible guiding unit in the area – girls and adults can still take part. If they are already a member, they should speak to their leader or local commissioner to find out what options are available. Leaders should email the relevant unit (above) to start the process. Please also get in contact if you have any questions before you transfer members.

If they’re not already a member, they’ll need to [register their interest](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/information-for-parents/register-your-daughter/){:.external-link}{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, and then when it comes to choosing their preferred units they’ll need to pop this postcode, **AL9 6GH**, into the search box before selecting the relevant Hertfordshire Flexible unit.
