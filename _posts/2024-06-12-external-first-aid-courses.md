If you have already undertaken first aid training, either in the workplace or personally, you may already meet Girlguiding's current requirements.

All elements of the [Girlguiding 1st response syllabus](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/globalassets/docs-and-resources/learning-and-development/1st-response/1st-response-syllabus-july-2023.pdf){:.download-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} must have been covered, paying particular attention to those that must be demonstrated both in practice, as well as in theory. You can find out more about the requirements via the button below.

f your course meets Girlguiding requirements you can use Anglia region’s ‘[Quick guide to uploading your first aid course evidence](https://www.girlguiding-anglia.org.uk/download/quick-guide-to-uploading-your-first-response-course-evidence){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} ’ to navigate the process on the learning platform to submit your external first aid qualification (certificate and course syllabus) for regional verification. 

Note: At step 4 of the process, select the 16-hour first aid qualification option if you wish to use it for:

- Specific outdoor qualifications e.g. walking, climbing. 
- Both outdoor qualifications and unit level guiding. Upload evidence to the 16-hour outdoor first aid qualification area for it to be approved for outdoor use first and then transferred over to verifiers to review against the criteria for unit level use.

When uploading an external 1st response, please ensure you allow a minimum of 21 days for it to be signed off. This is to allow time for the region verifiers to review your upload and share any feedback which may require action from you. 

Should region verifiers request additional information to support your application, you will receive an email from the Anglia region verifier setting out the requirements.  

Anglia’s ‘[Quick guide to uploading additional information](https://www.girlguiding-anglia.org.uk/download/quick-guide-to-uploading-additional-information){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} ’ provides a step-by-step guide on how to upload additional information to the learning platform.

If you have any difficulties, please contact the region office by emailing: <learning@girlguiding-anglia.org.uk>.
