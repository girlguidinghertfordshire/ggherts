The Introduction to the Hills team are looking for volunteers to help with [ITTH 2023](/event/introduction-to-the-hills/).

The event takes place between Friday 28 April and Monday 1 May 2023 and offers Guides and Scouts from Hertfordshire the opportunity to take part in activities in the Peak District.

Participants will walk, climb, cave and cycle, and therefore we would welcome volunteers with experience in these fields, although this is not a requirement.

There is a fee of Â£45 which covers food and board (indoor accommodation is available).

Subject to capacity, transport can be provided at no extra cost from one of our minibus pick-up points around the county.

Please note eligible Girlguiding members attending as a volunteer can use this as their Queen's Guide award residential.

If you are interested in volunteering please contact <info@itth.org.uk> by Thursday 16 March.
