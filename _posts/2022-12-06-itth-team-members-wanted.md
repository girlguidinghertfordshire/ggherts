The Introduction to the Hills team are looking for leaders to join their friendly team of organisers.

There are a few vacancies open in administration, treasury and facilities lead.

These roles would meet the requirements of the Queenâ€™s Guide Elements 2 and 4 so may appeal to those undertaking the Queens Guide Award.

Full support and training will be provided, and no previous experience is required.
