The Great Patrol Hunt team are looking for a caterer for next year's GPH Round 3 (and hopefully thereafter), providing catering for leaders from the Friday evening and then for the whole camp from Saturday breakfast to Sunday breakfast inclusive.  

**Previous experience preferred but not essential as training can be provided.**

To give an idea of scale, this year (2022) 120 girls and 30 leaders attended.

Indoor catering facilities may be available, depending on the campsite chosen, but a camp kitchen is equally welcome.  

The 2023 camp is due to take place on **Friday 30 - Sunday 2 July 2023** (venue to be confirmed)

To enquire about this vacancy and join the highly successful GPH team please contact <countysec@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>
