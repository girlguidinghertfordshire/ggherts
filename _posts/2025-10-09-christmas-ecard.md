Can you come up with a festive design to form the basis for this yearâ€™s county Christmas ecard?

- Include the following wording: "Merry Christmas", "Happy Christmas" or "Seasons Greetings". No other wording must be included within the design.
- Include your first name and full unit name.

The county Christmas ecard will be sent to all county members who have opted into receiving marketing communications, from the county commissioner, along with a festive message.

The winning design will also be featured on the county website/social media pages.
Please email your design(s) to <competition@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> (ensuring it is between 1-3mb in size where possible) before midnight on Sunday 16 November.

By entering the competition, your parent/guardian is consenting to the use of the card image and first name in the ways described in the terms of entry above.

Good luck!
