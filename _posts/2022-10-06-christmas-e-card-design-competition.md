We&lsquo;re looking for Rainbows, Brownies, Guides, Rangers and Young Leaders to design a colourful festive image for this year&lsquo;s Christmas E-card.

Details of the competition are as follows:

- The image should be no bigger than **A5** (148 x 210mm).
- The image can include *"Merry Christmas"*, *"Happy Christmas"* or *"Seasons Greetings"* but no other wording.

The winning design will be sent from the county commissioner, along with a festive message, to all county members who have opted into receiving marketing messages.

The design will also be featured on the county website/social media pages.  

The winning design will include your **first name and unit** underneath so please ensure you include these details when submitting your designs.

The deadline to send us your designs is **Sunday 13 November.**

Please email a digital image/photograph of your design (ensuring it is between 1-3mb in size where possible) to <countysec@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>

Alternatively, post your design (allowing plenty of time for delivery due to proposed postal strikes) to ‘Christmas E-Card Competition’, County Office, Herts Guide Centre, Cottered, Herts SG9 9QP.

Please note by entering the competition, your parent/guardian is consenting to the use of the image and first name in the ways described in the terms of entry above.
