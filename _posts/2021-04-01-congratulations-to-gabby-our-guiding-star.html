<p>Well done, well done, well done to Gabby, a 1st Birch Green Brownie, who was surprised to have the region chief commissioner and county commissioner join her Brownie Zoom meeting recently to present her with a Guiding Star Award!<img class="size-medium wp-image-4141 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2021/04/Gabby-Guiding-Star-Photo-1-1-149x300.jpeg" alt="" width="149" height="300" /></p>
