If you have undertaken external first aid training and wish this to be used within your Girlguiding role your external course must have been delivered on a **face-to-face** basis and last at least **6 hours**. It must have included both **child and adult CPR** and covered all the clauses in the _Girlguiding 1st Response syllabus_.  

If there are any clauses which were not covered, you may wish to discuss this shortfall with a Girlguiding trainer. Please speak to your commissioner if you need to arrange this.
