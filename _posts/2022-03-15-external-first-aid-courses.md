If you have undertaken external first aid training and wish this to be used within your Girlguiding role please email your request to the county office (<admin@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>) providing:

- A copy of your external first aid certificate **AND**
- A copy of the full course syllabus.

The county administrators will forward these on to the Anglia region verifier who will check the evidence against the Girlguiding criteria, and make a decision, requesting further information if necessary.

Please allow adequate time for this process.

If your training fulfils the criteria, the region verifier will advise the county administrators who will then add the qualification to your GO record accordingly.

**Please note:** To be a recognised first aider in Girlguiding you **must** also complete the 1st response e-learning via the [Girlguiding Learning Platform][2]{:.external-link}{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

**Completion of this e-learning module must show on your GO record before an external first aid qualification can be added.**
