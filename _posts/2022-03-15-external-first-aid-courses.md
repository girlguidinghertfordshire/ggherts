If you have undertaken external first aid training, either in the work place or personally, you may have already received the training you need to meet Girlguiding's current requirements.

Details of what your course needs to have covered can be found here:

[Accepted first aid qualifications](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/information-for-volunteers/learning-and-development/first-aid-training/accepted-first-aid-qualifications/){:.btn.btn-primary.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}

To be a recognised first aider in Girlguiding you **must** also complete the 1st response e-learning module via the [Girlguiding Learning Platform][2]{:.external-link}{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

If you want to apply for your qualification to be accepted within your Girlguiding role **you must completed the short e-learning module first.**

Then email <admin@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> providing:

- A copy of your external first aid certificate **AND**
- A copy of the full course syllabus.

The county administrators will forward these on to the Anglia region verifier who will check the evidence against the Girlguiding criteria, and make a decision, requesting further information if necessary.

Please allow adequate time for this process.

If your training fulfils the criteria, the region verifier will advise the county administrators who will then add the qualification to your GO record accordingly.
