If you have undertaken external first aid training and wish this to be used within your Girlguiding role your external course must have been delivered on a **face-to-face** basis and last at least **6 hours**. It must have included both **child and adult CPR** and covered all the same elements _Girlguiding 1st response_ courses.  

**Please note:** To be a recognised first aider in Girlguiding you **must** also complete the 1st response e-learning via the [Girlguiding Learning Platform][2]{:.external-link}{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

**Completion of this e-learning module must show on your GO record before an external first aid qualification can be added.**

## Submitting your request

Email your request to the county office (<admin@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>) providing:

1. A copy of your external first aid certificate
2. A copy of the course syllabus.

The county administrators will forward these on to the Anglia region verifier who will check the evidence against the Girlguiding criteria, and make a decision, requesting further information if necessary.

If the qualification does fulfil the criteria, the region verifier will advise the county administrators, who will add the qualification to your GO record accordingly.
