Do you lack the confidence to take your girls for a local walk, maybe in woodland or along the canal or river? Would you benefit from a bit of help with map reading, planning a route and doing a risk assessment? 

If so, **level 1 training** is for you. We are thinking of running this in **October/November**. 

Please email [walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk](mailto:walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk) if youâ€™d like to join in so we can gauge interest.
