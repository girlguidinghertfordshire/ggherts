We are looking for volunteers, of all ages, to help at this year's [Hertfordshire County Show](https://hertsshow.com/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}, taking place over the weekend of Saturday 23 - Sunday 24 May at The Showground in Redbourn.

This is the county's flagship event which celebrates all things country: living, food and farming.

The weekend will be packed with lots of entertainment and activities. With over 35,000 visitors each year, this is the place to be!

Helpers will receive free tickets to the show for themselves and their immediate family.
