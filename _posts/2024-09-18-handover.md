Not only has this September marked the start of another term of Guiding, as we all return to our weekly unit meetings, it's also time to say goodbye to Jenny Maskrey as the county commissioner and welcome Karin Hunter!

Jenny stepped up to the role as the county commissioner in September 2019, having been a unit leader previously. She led the county through the Covid-19 pandemic, enabling girls to stay involved during lockdown, even if we couldn’t meet up in person. Behind the scenes, Jenny worked hard to improve our IT system, website and make sure that information was available to commissioners and others in the wider county team.

Jenny Maskrey said, “It’s been tough at times, but it’s been fun and rewarding.  I won’t miss the constant flow of emails, but I will miss the connections with the girls and the volunteers. I wish Karin and her team all the best of luck, have fun!”

Jenny said, “thanks to the amazing assistants, who have become good friends”.

- Ruth has shared her knowledge of being a ACC previously.
- Sally has put her life and soul into the role, with some crazy ideas along the way.
- Anne has dedicated her time to the Hertfordshire Guide Centre and generally getting her hands very dirty.
- Karin joined the team a year ago and is full of energy and enthusiasm!

Karin takes over as the new county commissioner, alongside newly appointed assistant county commissioners, Janet Eavis (Membership) and Liz Pinnington (Adventure).

Karin said, “I’m excited for the opportunity that Girlguiding Anglia has given me as I start my next chapter in volunteering with Girlguiding Hertfordshire as County Commissioner. The team and I are looking forward to meeting with you, so that together, every girl can be herself, develop her skills and feel at home in a safe & inclusive environment”.

Janet said, “I am looking forward to meeting & supporting our fabulous volunteers who help girls in Hertfordshire know they can do anything”.

Liz said, "I am thoroughly looking forward to this opportunity and working with volunteer members across the county in continuing to offer adventures to all”.

There is currently a vacancy for an assistant county commissioner to lead the Growth and retention / marketing team. Find out more: <https://www.girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk/get-involved/vacancies/>
