Everyone needs to have the correct level of [a safe space training][1] for their role.

## Training structure

With the introduction of the [Learning Platform][2]{:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} we encourage you to familiarise yourself with the current guidance. This explains all four levels of a safe space training, which may be relevant to your role, as well as the introduction of the young members (14 - 17 years old) e-learning module.

Please remember that **membership may be withdrawn** if you do not complete the levels required for your role.

## Completing your training

### Levels 1 and 2

A safe space levels 1 and 2 e-learning training modules can both be completed via the learning platform. Each takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.

[Start level 1 or level 2 e-learning][3]{:.btn.btn-primary.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}

### Level 3

This training is delivered by a live online session with Girlguiding Anglia. Alternatively, you can enrol to attend a national webinar session through the learning platform.

### Level 4

This session is aimed at commissioners. You can attend a face-to-face training or enrol for a national webinar session via the [Girlguiding learning platform.][3]{:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}

## Renewing your training

When your current a safe space qualification is due to expire you will be given a renewal window. Expiry dates and renewal windows are displayed on your [learning dashboard][3]{:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} within the learning platform.

It is essential that you do not complete your training before your window opens as completion will not be recognised and you will be required to complete it again.

The online level 3 renewal e-learning course can only be accessed if your level 3 is currently in-date. If it has expired, you’ll need to complete the full level 3 training session.

How the renewals process works is explained in depth on the [Girlguiding UK, a safe space training webpage.][5]{:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}
