<p>Many volunteers already make decisions and additional provision for their personal safety as a matter of course. The introduction of the <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lone-volunteering-policy-sept-2020.pdf">lone volunteering policy</a> will help reinforce and support those decisions and will help volunteers to give further attention to keeping themselves and those they support safe. It will also help volunteers to challenge any situations where they might feel uncomfortable carrying out a task on their own. It does not apply to volunteering activities carried out in volunteers' own home.Â  The <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lone-volunteering-procedures_sept-2020_-final.pdf">lone volunteering procedures</a> support the policy.</p>
