Silver Smarties is an easy way to help raise money for HGC. Give parents and young members (and anyone else who would like to be involved) as tube of Smarties and ask them to please return the tube, filled with 20p pieces, by a certain date.

Ask young members to complete tasks, chores or activities to earn 20p from friends and family to fill the tubes.

Send out reminders and you could ask at your unit meeting what chore have you done to help others with ideas.

Collect the tubes on the closing date, count up, take out the cost of the smartie tubes from the amount raised. Send the profits to HGC.

We’ve given you these Smarties to eat  
But the empty tube you must keep  
For every task done, earn 20p  
It’s up to you to earn your fee  
Fill up your tube, right to the top  
Return in three weeks for our HGC pot!  

Or  

We’ve given you these Smarties to eat  
But the empty tube you must keep  
20p pieces are what you must find  
Ask friends and family, they won’t mind  
Fill up your tube, right to the top  
Return in three weeks and well collect the lot!
