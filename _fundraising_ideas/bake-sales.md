Tea and coffee meeting are not only a great for getting people together for a chat but they give you the opportunity to be a fundraiser as well.

People love to a bake-off, so lets give them the chance to show off their skills and help us raise money towards Girlguiding Hertfordshire Centreâ€™s refurbishment at the same time. You could make it into a competition.

Please do make sure a list of ingredients is visible for each item to cover any allergies.
