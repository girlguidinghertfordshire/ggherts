To set up a learning platform account, you will first need to have registered an account on GO
using the email address on your GO record.

GO and the Learning Platform are two separate systems, but they do ‘talk’ to each other. The username will always be the same on the two systems but you should set a different password for each. Please be aware that if you change the password on one system it will not change on the other.

## For enquirers

You’ll be invited to set up a GO account as soon as you’ve registered. To activate it, use the email address you registered with and the 'Invitation code' will be in your email. You can also request a code by clicking on the 'I don’t have a login' invitation code link on [girlguiding.org.uk](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}

Once you’ve set this up, you’ll need to **wait 24 hours**, and then you’ll be able to set up the login for the learning platform and do your a safe space training. You don’t need to wait for your DBS or references to be processed, you can do this straight away.

## For members

Go to [girlguiding.org.uk](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} and click on Login to GO at the top of the page.

If you have never logged into GO before you can use the *‘Don’t have a login’* button, on the [GO
login screen](https://go.girlguiding.org.uk/SignIn){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}, to receive an invitation code. Please make sure you use the **same email address** which you have used in your enquiry or, if you are already a member, the one on your GO record.

If you have already registered an account but have forgotten your login details, please use the
‘Forgotten Username’ and or Forgotten Password’ buttons. You will receive an email giving you the
information you need.

After you have set up your GO account, a Learning Platform account will automatically be set up for you, but you will need to **wait 24 hours** and then set up separate login details for the Platform.

If you are unable to access the email address which you have on your record and need this to be
changed please email <membershipsystems@girlguiding.org.uk> or for a speedier resolution phone
them on [0800 999 2016](tel:08009992016) or [020 7834 6242](tel:02078346242).

## Creating an account on the Learning Platform

When you are ready to access your Learning Platform account you can use this link to the login page: [learning.girlguiding.org.uk](https://learning.girlguiding.org.uk){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}

[![Girlguiding Learning login screen](/assets/images/2023/06/learning-platform-login.webp){:.pull-left.m-3}](https://learning.girlguiding.org.uk){:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}
You will use the *same username* that you use for GO but will set a **different password.**

To set your password, click the forgotten password link, which will send an email (to the address on your GO record) with a reset link.

Click on the reset link in your email and input a new password.

You will then be able to access the platform and complete your ‘a safe space’ or any other e-learnings and webinars you are interested in. Any e-learnings you complete will take 24 - 48 hours to synchronize over to your GO account.

If you have any trouble accessing the platform, completing the e-learning or your course has not registered on GO, please email <membershipsystems@girlguiding.org.uk> and they should be able to help.

## Troubleshooting receiving invitation emails

If you are not receiving the invitation email check your spam/Junk folder. Make girlguiding.org.uk and <noreply@learningpool.com> a trusted domain in your email client and try again.

### Setting Girlguiding as trusted domain in Outlook web

To set a domain active in Outlook on the web (refer to your email supplier for other clients), go to Settings/ View all Outlook settings/Email/Junk email and add under the Safe senders and domains.

If that doesn't work, contact <membershipsystems@girlguiding.org.uk> or for a speedier resolution phone them on 0800 999 2016 or 02078 346 242. Phone would obviously be best, as any email reply may disappear into the ether along with the others!
