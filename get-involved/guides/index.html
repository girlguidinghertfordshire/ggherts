<div class="clearfix d-md-none"></div>A place where they can explore the things they love and do stuff they've never
done before. Where else can you think up a new sport, make a new perfume, cook over a campfire, design an advertising
campaign, have a mocktail party, raise money for a charity you believe in?</p>
<p>At Guides, they can do all of this and loads more. And they&rsquo;re in charge: they choose what they do, and can earn badges and awards as they go, if that&rsquo;s their thing.</p>
<p>From regular meetings with their guiding friends and volunteers to going away to festivals, camps, and trips with girls from other places, Guides is one big adventure. </p>

<p>In advance, speak with their <strong>current unit
    leader</strong> about available local opportunities. There might not be a place for them straight away, so they may
  have to be added to your chosen unit&rsquo;s waiting list. It is therefore advisable to make enquiries as soon as
  possible.</p>
