<h3>Marshmallow Snowmen ⛄</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s another Christmassy idea using marshmallows&#8230; and an easy activity to do on Zoom during cold or snowy weather next term ❄️❄️❄️</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Items needed:</span> kebab stick to hold the three large marshmallows, mini Jaffa cake and rolo for the hat, icing or melted chocolate to stick the Smartie buttons on and coloured icing for the face.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Marshmallow-Snowmen.pdf">See what the Marshmallow Snowmen look like</a>.</p>
<h3>Armpit Fudge</h3>
<p>Fudge is a festive treat &#8211; but have you tried making it this way before? <a href="https://www.girlguidingscotland.org.uk/for-volunteers/how-to-run-your-unit/activities-to-do-with-your-unit/cooking/armpit-fudge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here</a> for the recipe and instructions.</p>
<p>Great fun for a Zoom meeting, just let everyone know the ingredients they will need in advance!</p>

<h3>S&#8217;MORES &#8211; Midsummer Sleepover 2020</h3>
<p>Never made a S&#8217;more before? Here&#8217;s Veronica Riches to show you how&#8230;️ <span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">🍪</span></span><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">🍥</span></span><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">🍪</span></span></p>
<p>How about toasting your marshmallow over a tealight?? <span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">🕯</span></span></p>
<p>Veronica likes her marshmallows toasted until they are JUST gooey, before being sandwiched between two chocolate digestive biscuits <span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">😋</span></span> How do you like yours?</p>

<h3>Easy Chocolate Brownies</h3>
<p>Last week on Great British Bake Off, none of the bakers managed to produce a perfect Brownie &#8211; so let&#8217;s show them how we get on!</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://www.cookingwithmykids.co.uk/chocolate-brownies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Berry&#8217;s Easy Chocolate Brownie recipe</a> 😋<br />
Have fun trying this with your kid&#8217;s over half term, or use it as a baking activity for a Zoom meeting.</p>

<h3>Snowflake Challenge? ❄️❄️❄️</h3>
<p>Cut out a paper circle. Fold in half to make a semi-circle. Next fold into thirds ie. making two folds in the semi-circle so you end up with a triangular shape. This gives you the starting point for a 6 point snowflake. See the <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Snowflake-Challenge.pdf">Snowflake patterns</a> you can make then try cutting them out.</p>
<h3>Get Creative using Natural Resources</h3>
<p>Encourage girls to enjoy the natural resources we have around us <span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">🍂</span></span></p>
<p>Ask girls to collect leaves and twigs when they are out on a walk, or on the way back from school. Remind them to bring paper, pens, scissors, glue and any suitable recycled bits to the meeting.</p>
<p>Encourage everyone to make something using the leaves as a focal point. Have fun sharing the variety of their creations.</p>
<h3>Draw and Paint a Hedgehog</h3>
<p>So who wouldn&#8217;t want to give this a go?? <span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">😍</span></span></p>
<p>How about following up with talking about caring for wildlife in our gardens during the winter?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?ref=saved&amp;v=390017315729356&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDm-afd86y9G_U9AAqI1H4Du1IBplg78QJCJ_9fQnbyUfEzJJYX5vHPV1YrqScOMD9blNqocyqk2VoDjQAGRWaPm3C7ViqlH7RGDAnLi7tIZXjYy-jZC-NivGp78-7egOkIiwUuYikVPGvnwt5c6R6jEEekONczG20F6UAaUrgHV4OJahUC0s_Sv_8kWa2hBrLN2DMMqkkRsKjuyy23_CEX4JbqcZsAbqh1KMqWp04gpG4li_RrEKAAyHLUczInEweviXbXBVfwlAHEXbKFKL9GNBLcMFZuv5f5iVdvG33X9FAb05zTMxW_8pUSpScjPmhepjzx2JIdkDS6HZzjeM8_yj22VSpkRmDC8s0pJpQY_D6rBtvst2PcLNEU26JgRg7BapzH36O3o_Za43DIBkp0pPH56EvGr98lc4KHGM9ggzbtsNzITj-Y979SC1zr-FM2hkuP72OdRCSyONaIGh_gN50z3RIDfsBLlcCLXH9vlIh8NaQ3sUpTmevjK077erUF&amp;__tn__=-UK-R" data-ft="{">https://www.facebook.com/watch/?ref=saved&amp;v=390017315729356</a></p>
<h3>Broccoli Stamped Fall Leaves</h3>
<p>An amazingly simple way to paint an autumnal tree 🍂. <a href="https://www.gluedtomycraftsblog.com/2015/11/broccoli-stamped-fall-tree-kid-craft.html?fbclid=IwAR2bE0y7SPRjzGSoJfEWrQo4EtSWuJXefKHET9EBZY3YSN07Jt9X80vvFYo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.gluedtomycraftsblog.com/2015/11/broccoli-stamped-fall-tree-kid-craft.html?fbclid=IwAR2bE0y7SPRjzGSoJfEWrQo4EtSWuJXefKHET9EBZY3YSN07Jt9X80vvFYo</a></p>
<h3>Positive Pebbles</h3>
<p>A wonderfully positive and mindful activity for all the family&#8230; and a great visual for leaders planning the Brownie &#8216;Positive Pebbles&#8217; Unit Meeting Activity. See the <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Positive-Pebbles.pdf">positive pebble examples here</a>.</p>
<p>If girls don&#8217;t have pebbles and paint to hand, how about planning to do this on paper bunting instead?</p>
<h3>Aromatic Playdough</h3>
<p>As we head into autumn &#8211; how about having a go at making this aromatic playdough? <a href="https://theimaginationtree.com/autumn-spice-play-dough-recipe/?fbclid=IwAR2PXTHGLa67QEd8WZ_UQ0N6R_hlCs64n8ELFnHgF9bZh21KmHXxbBoth3c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here</a> for the recipe. Hours of fun for children at home&#8230;</p>
<p>If made in advance, girls could bring it to a Zoom meeting along with natural bits and pieces for a seasonal crafting session 🍁🍂🌾</p>
<p>Perhaps it could even be made at the start of a Zoom meeting -Rainbows and Brownies would need ADULT supervision with the boiling water. The crafting session could be done later in the meeting when the playdough is cool 🙂</p>
<h3>Fall Leaf Owl Craft</h3>
<p>Whoooo wouldn&#8217;t you like to make cute owls?  A great craft idea for using some of the leaves girls have been collecting in last week&#8217;s Scavenger Hunt 🍂.  For instructions on how to make them <a href="http://krokotak.com/2020/09/fall-leaf-owl-craft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here</a>.</p>
<h3>Halloween Ghost Toy</h3>
<p>A fun craft for children to make with some adult assistance 👩‍👧‍👧 For instructions <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/videos/2815550435212059/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here</a>.  How about drawing a girl in her Rainbow or Brownie uniform on the cup, and imagining she is skipping??</p>

<h3>A Further Ten ACTION games for girls to play in a Zoom meeting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Musical Statues &#8211; play lively music loudly on your phone and hold it right next to the speaker on your laptop, to minimise fading in and out on girls’ devices</li>
<li>Biscuit on Forehead &#8211; each girl starts with a biscuit on their forehead, then tries to get it in her mouth without using her hands! Girls might want numerous attempts at this one!!</li>
<li>Fireworks – name a firework, then ask the girls to act out the motion and sound it would make eg. rockets, sparklers, squealers, fountains, starbursts, Catherine wheel</li>
<li>How long is a Minute? &#8211; each girl starts sitting down, and leader indicates when she starts a timer. Girls are asked to stand when they think a minute has passed. Who will be closest?</li>
<li>Number and Action Game – leader 1 calls an action (star jumps, clapping hands etc) and leader 2 rolls a dice/ calls a number. Girls do the chosen action the number of times indicated by the dice</li>
<li>Charades</li>
<li>Increasing Numbers Scavenger Hunt &#8211; so 1 of the first item, 2 of the second, 3 of the third etc</li>
<li>Musical Chairs &#8211; each girl dances round their own chair until the music stops. Make sure girls are using sturdy chairs, and not swivel office chairs in case of an accident!</li>
<li>‘Snap’ Bingo &#8211; first girl says a fact about herself eg. has blue eyes, wears hair in a ponytail, has a brother. Any girls who match spin round and put thumbs up. Each girl takes a turn in saying her fact.</li>
<li>Body Parts on Floor &#8211; ask girls to strike a pose with a given number of body parts touching the floor… 2 is easy, but what about 1, 3, 4, and maybe even 5? Encourage them to be creative, but to remain safe with the poses they choose!</li>
</ul>
<h3>TEN more games to play in a Zoom meeting</h3>
<p>These will need a little preparation beforehand:</p>
<ol>
<li>Knife/ Fork/ Spoon &#8211; ask the girls to bring a knife, fork and spoon, play as for Rock/ Paper/ Scissors</li>
<li>Number Bingo &#8211; girls draw a grid of 12 on paper, and choose 12 numbers between 11 and 20. Leader calls out numbers at random. Who can be first to score a line? Who will be first to shout BINGO?</li>
<li>No See Drawing &#8211; girls are told a simple object which they have to draw with their eyes closed. Have fun comparing results!</li>
<li>Hangman &#8211; played on the whiteboard</li>
<li>Badges Bingo &#8211; girls draw a grid of 8 (Rainbows), 12 (Brownies) or 16 (Guides). Ask them to fill in squares with the names interest badges for their section. They can always refer to their Badge books of they can&#8217;t think of them all! Then call out interest badges at random, and see who is first to score a line, and who is first to shout BINGO!<br />
How about using this as an opportunity to showcase the range of interest badges and ask girls which they will work on next?</li>
<li>Pass a Pen – each girl has a pen, first girl passes it across the screen and names who she is ‘passing’ it to. Named girl then passes her pen across her screen and names another girl. Challenge the girls to remember who hasn’t had a go yet, and to choose them next. Play this a few times and see if you can improve your time for completing with every girl having had a go. Explain this game is about thinking of others, as well as having fun 😊</li>
<li>Drawing in Numbers – ask the girls to draw themselves using only numbers (see post on 13th Oct, and example in comments below). Next can they draw a ‘number’ animal?</li>
<li>Generation Game – played as Kim’s game, but leader passes a given number of objects slowly across her screen… then girls write down as many as they can remember (perhaps Rainbows could remember verbally?)</li>
<li>Pictionary &#8211; played on the whiteboard</li>
<li>Pillowcase Game – girls are asked to fill a pillowcase with 10 random objects. Leader then asks 10 questions (eg favourite thing to play with, favourite thing to eat, something to bring to Brownies) and girls each produce an object from their pillowcase as their answer. They may have to get very inventive with their last answers!</li>
</ol>
<h3>TEN games to play on ZOOM with minimal or NO prep <span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">😊</span></span></h3>
<ol>
<li>Simon Says (Brown Owl Says)</li>
<li>I Spy (anything that can be seen on screen)</li>
<li>Bean Game (Jumping Bean, French Bean, Beans on toast etc)</li>
<li>Heads or Tails (girls put hands on heads or bottoms, and leader flips a coin for heads or tails)</li>
<li>Buzzy Bees (girls buzz around and flap little wings, when leader shouts &#8216;Flower&#8217; everyone has to freeze)</li>
<li>Guess Who (one Brownie chooses someone, and the others ask questions with yes/ no answers to guess who)</li>
<li>Higher or Lower (using a pack of cards)</li>
<li>True or False (leader gives a fact, and girls indicate true or false with thumbs up or down)</li>
<li>Girls show using only their hands and face, something they did during the week</li>
<li>Rock Paper Scissors (can you beat the leader’s choice?)</li>
<li>Bingo</li>
<li>Beetle</li>
<li>Guess Who dressing up (using hats, scarves, gloves, wigs, moustaches etc)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Brownie Bells in British Sign Language 👍</h3>
<p>Brownie leaders &#8211; how about finishing your Zoom meetings by signing rather than singing Brownie Bells?  Girls love to try something new, and this could be a useful starting point for a discussion about inclusion 🙌. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX72YZXfzRk&amp;fbclid=IwAR2Nne3Gk3Sry2AqGbt84ErYEXh4m5Vbmr5JVdorzeSuJopzljlC88SMbsQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here</a> for the  Brownie Bells signing video.</p>

<h3>2020 Year in Review Activity Sheet</h3>
<p>How about using this <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2020-My-Year-in-Review.pdf">2020 Year in Review Activity Sheet </a>in your next Zoom meeting?</p>
<p>A creative way to help girls think about the good bits from last year, and their hopes for this year&#8230;</p>
<h3>How many words can you make using the phrase &#8216;Brownies are Awesome&#8217;?</h3>
<p>Another starter activity or fun game for girls to do on Zoom.  How many words can they make using the letters in the phrase &#8216;Brownies are Awesome&#8217;? What is the longest word anyone can think of?</p>
<p>Change the phrase to suit your section: so Guides can ponder over &#8216;Guides are Awesome&#8217; 💙</p>
<h3>Another puzzle for Brownies to solve</h3>
<p>Download the <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Secret-Message-Puzzle.pdf">secret message puzzle here</a>.  Particularly suitable for a Brownie Promise night 😉.</p>
<h3>Who Is &#8230;&#8230;.<span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">❓</span></span></h3>
<p>This is an activity aimed at building self-esteem and confidence &#8211; use the image on Share Screen to initiate discussion and reflection. (Could link in with Be Kind and current world news)</p>
<p>Idea <span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">1️⃣</span></span> Identify celebrities/ famous people with each of these qualities/ skills<br />
Idea <span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">2️⃣</span></span> Girls rank or identify top 3 qualities/skills for themselves<br />
Idea <span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">3️⃣</span></span> Ask girls to identify another girl &#8211; You are &#8230;. because&#8230;.</p>
<h3>Riddle Time</h3>
<p>Use this <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Riddle-Time.pdf">riddle</a> as a starter activity, as your girls join a Zoom meeting? Put it up on Share Screen, so that each girl can work on it whilst you wait for the inevitable latecomers&#8230; perhaps let the girls know in advance there will be a puzzle waiting for them when they log in <span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">🤔</span></span></p>
<h3>Parliament Week</h3>

<h3>Draw Yourself Using Only Numbers</h3>
<p>How about this idea for a quick filler activity on Zoom?</p>
<p>Ask the girls to draw themselves using only numbers &#8211; <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Draw-Yourself-using-Numbers.pdf">click here</a> for an example in which:<br />
8 &#8211; body and head<br />
3 -hair, 0 &#8211; eyes, 6 &#8211; nose, 7 &#8211; smile<br />
3 &#8211; legs, 9 &#8211; feet<br />
1 &#8211; arms, 7 &#8211; hands</p>
<p>Encourage the girls come up with their own formulas!</p>
<p>If they enjoy the activity, then perhaps you could challenge them to draw numeric animals another time?</p>

<p>Share some positivity!</p>
<p>Ask children to leave three positive notes around the home to brighten someone&#8217;s day. How about a joke, a funny face <span class="text_exposed_show">and an inspirational quote?</span></p>
<h4>Social Games for Lockdown</h4>
<p>Stuck at home and wondering what to do with your children?</p>
<p>Here are some wonderful ideas, which can be adapted for whatever ages are playing&#8230; fun for all the family <span class="_47e3 _5mfr" title="smile emoticon"><img loading="lazy" class="img" role="presentation" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t4c/1/16/1f642.png" alt="" width="16" height="16" /></span></p>

<h4>Scavenger Hunt</h4>
<p>Here&#8217;s a super Scavenger hunt to encourage youngsters to go out and about looking for signs of autumn 🍂🍁</p>
<p>How about asking girls to collect a variety of leaves and seeds to use for a craft activity &#8211; which could be done at either a face to face or Zoom meeting 👍. Use this <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Autumn-Scavenger-Hunt.pdf">scavenger hunt list</a>.</p>
<h4>Activities you could do at home in the garden</h4>
<p>The Hertfordshire Wildlife Trust have some great ideas to do in the garden from creating bee hotels to creating container gardens for wildlife.  Please check out their <a href="https://www.hertswildlifetrust.org.uk/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>.</p>
<h4>Sew your badges</h4>
<p>Lots of us have got more time on our hands &#8211; so why not use them and sew your badges onto something? How many of you have badges waiting to be sewn onto your gilet, sash, uniform or camp blanket? Can you learn to sew them on yourself? Ask a grown up for help and learn a new skill.</p>
<h4>Have fun with emojis <span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">🙂</span></span></h4>
<p>What film titles can you depict using just emojis? Probably everyone can guess <span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">❄️</span></span><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">⛄️</span></span><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">👭</span></span><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">🏰</span></span></p>

<h4>A-Z Scavenger Hunt</h4>
<p>Make a list from A to Z. Can you can find things around your home beginning with every letter of the alphabet?. Which letters were the most difficult? What were the funniest things you found?<br />
Share your weird and wonderful findings with your friends!</p>
<h4>Keep a Journal</h4>
<p>This activity is most suitable for Rangers, Guides and older Brownies. We are living in a time of enormous change and uncertainty. Maybe this will open up conversations where girls can share their observations and feelings about what they are experiencing?</p>
<h4>Make your Promise in Makaton</h4>
<p>Here is a great activity for all sections to try. How many of us will be able to make our promise in Makaton when we meet again? Makaton is a language programme that uses signs and symbols. Anyone can practise making the Makaton promise (e<span class="text_exposed_show">ven if you&#8217;ve already made yours!). </span><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">🤚</span></span> See more instructions and videos: <a href="https://bit.ly/2xHZ0Lj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-ft="{" data-lynx-mode="async" data-lynx-uri="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2xHZ0Lj&amp;h=AT3wn6wriRcS0MM-akGORR6qAob4NDiXiiAIroWY6qNDo5O2kS6WkEZrdBZdBvtI_lvTv1srkgkpWW556nz-UMYlRHcDyptMihAGRx5-7fWY3l4rfbga6XHnxAXT99tNHF2SBlCa6asHUo8phExm9cpWdEBnJ0hVMvC6IKqKxhp85ZKTFaPyMhx1mdS_6Qi2OXF5kI9qs6Eb0ACzpL296iDE5XU6amAy4sz5GVH9BYEREAvcskd3KI4A-BdeUs4LssO1C39yj-uBOz4OtZEMowzYuLSgnK7GaDEoqcSndS1NUDJUsFxH38TvQYp6ftl_Y3Kw0_ybPdU23wpprnbbEG2IcJDnyALkf5Evix1Ln66G3NbbhG_17oG7EeVN0YDQGxAhAGDlGHikzXiR-_rTqAMr_xvLvBeYy-NwHQMSL5FGgnhfNg2pXGBpA7EQb-AE6fOcmdzqq1UFtXhKZ-5yqgJWCb-jAFtRpzre7r9NJqPc2oxaP36ZgnFQRAYhvqj7eMFjmhyjuhWCFnu6OPZSPYeHNJry_UpLnLn13-zRAGMRZR-mLXkLh_jZCiOK6quoPvw0uB9glRd552FoduCM7BjiUQBP1pX87lte2Nk1RywzddB7-Pqu2Ne28BUESexlSsgYcR7nNx3lWC4dToP_LPtk8TgBRHeIBtxfRclStbvoHGsEaoi8VdK-hfshovhaYaIARqW4Jg1ndTM4Y7jxOgp14ZGHEZRo_ENtwlVsNXNcOOW55pcJI9UMZx82iSMvRjLmJH5-g_KMj_ApjEpYrEtwaMSamGFFO3THcaJ9IrpXuPWvz8pbUP3l0O3g-w8kMsyz3IU6Q2-2g2gtp2fXzidc_9m79gbUQO5b-s2pHThrWsu1m4kr">https://bit.ly/2xHZ0Lj</a></p>
<h4>Start a Gratitude Book today</h4>
<p>Keep adding to it each week. This will be a useful reminder of all the things you are thankful for, to look through when you are feeling down.  In difficult times, it&#8217;s important to remember the positives. Take a photo or draw a picture of five things you&#8217;re thankful f<span class="text_exposed_show">or and put them all together to create a Gratitude book.</span></p>
<h4>Pamper Someone</h4>
<p>How about a nice treat for the weekend? Take time to pamper someone, to show how much you love them&#8230; maybe pamper the whole family, including yourself! Take someone breakfast in bed, run a bubbly bath, paint their nails, prepare a special meal&#8230; or simply make them a nice cup of tea or coffee, while they put their feet up <span class="_47e3 _5mfr" title="smile emoticon"><img loading="lazy" class="img" role="presentation" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t4c/1/16/1f642.png" alt="" width="16" height="16" /></span></p>

<h4>Fairy House</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s enjoy the good weather <span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">☀️</span></span> Here is something creative to do outside&#8230; Build a Fairy House using whatever you can find in your own garden: twigs, leaves, feathers, moss, stones, flowers (ask permission from a grown up before picking any flowers!) If you haven&#8217;t got a garden, collect some natural building materials when you are out for your daily walk. Bring them home and create your Fairy House indoors. Or how about making a Fairy House from recycled materials?</p>
<h4>Toy Safari</h4>
<p>Take your soft toys and teddy bears on holiday for the weekend! Create exciting places for them to visit around your home and garden. Take photos to show where they have been, and make a photo album of their adventures. Perhaps they could visit the Fairy House you made? Soft toys need adventure too! Create a photo diary of your toys having lots of adventures. Maybe they&#8217;ll go into the jungle (gard<span class="text_exposed_show">en or houseplant), or fall asleep somewhere they shouldn&#8217;t.</span></p>
<h4>Self Portrait</h4>
<p>Challenge: can you make a self-portrait without using any pens, pencils or paint? Use any objects you find around your house or garden. Be creative <span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">with st<span class="text_exposed_show">ring hair, pasta noses, buttonhole eyes &#8211; anything goes!</span></span></span>! <span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">🕶</span></span><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">🍂</span></span><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">🥚</span></span><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">🥐</span></span><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">🍇</span></span><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">🔑</span></span><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">✂️</span></span><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">🧲</span></span><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">📀</span></span><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">🧩 </span></span></p>
