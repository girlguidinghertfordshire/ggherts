There are many ways to get involved. Here you can find more information on each section, as well as how to register yourself or your daughter to join.

If your daughter is already a member of Girlguiding Hertfordshire and would like to progress to the next section (e.g. she's a Rainbow and would like to move up to Brownies) please **speak to her unit Leader** about the opportunities available.

## Girls and Young Women

## Volunteers

Once you turn 18 you can volunteer as an adult with Girlguiding. There are thousands of volunteers who help in so many ways, such as:

- Running a unit as a Leader, Assistant Leader, Unit Helper, or Occasional Helper
- Helping with the accounts or administration
- Teaching skills such as First Aid, or adventurous activities like sailing or climbing and units will often welcome support
- Supporting one of the local Girlguiding volunteer shops and depots
- Carry out gardening or DIY at a local site
- Fundraising for trips and special events

Volunteering can be beneficial in so many ways. You can learn new skills, boost your CV, as well as making friendships that can last a lifetime. Volunteers are supported by local Commissioners, can attend trainings and work on qualifications to help develop their skills. By volunteering with us you are able to support girls and young women to be their best.
