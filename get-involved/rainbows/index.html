            <p>Being a Rainbow is all about having the space to try new things. Through
            taking part in a range of different activities with girls their own age they develop self-confidence and

<h3 class="bg-light-blue my-2 p-3">The next step in her guiding journey</h3>
<p>When your daughter becomes old enough, she'll be able to move up into the next section of Girlguiding.</p>
<p>Here's a guide to when it might happen:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rainbows move up to Brownies aged 7</li>
  <li>Brownies move up to Guides aged 10</li>
  <li>Guides move up to Rangers aged 14</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="bg-light-blue my-1 p-2">How to move your daughter on</h3>
<p>In advance of your daughter's time to move on to the next section, speak with their <strong>current unit
    leader</strong> about available local opportunities. There might not be a place for them straight away, so they may
  have to be added to your chosen unit&rsquo;s waiting list. It is therefore advisable to make enquiries as soon as
  possible.</p>
