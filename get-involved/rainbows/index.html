<p><img src="/assets/images/core/rainbow-badge.webp" alt="New Rainbow badge" class="float-md-end ps-3 pb-3" loading="lazy" /><div class="clearfix d-md-none"></div>This is a place where your little one can stretch their wings &mdash; trying new things and putting their energy to
  good use under the watchful eyes of our caring volunteers. They&rsquo;ll laugh, sing and make a happy mess (and help
  clear
  it up!) with special friends in regular meetings.
</p>

<p>They can choose their way through our programme of activities: getting creative with crafts, learning through games
  and
  stories, exploring indoors and out, even going on their first sleepover.</p>

<p>They'll have plenty of magic moments to tell you all about: they might become a time traveller, an animal tracker, a
  pop
  singer, a stargazer. Rainbows is a wonderful world of adventure, week after week, just for them.</p>

<h2 class="mt-4">The next step in her guiding journey</h2>
<p>When your daughter becomes old enough, she'll be able to move up to <a href="../brownies/">Brownies</a></p>

<p>In advance, speak with their <strong>current unit
    leader</strong> about available local opportunities. There might not be a place for them straight away, so they may
  have to be added to your chosen unit&rsquo;s waiting list. It is therefore advisable to make enquiries as soon as
  possible.</p>
