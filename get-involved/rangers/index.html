<div class="clearfix d-md-none"></div>It&rsquo;s regular meetings with your local group, trips around the UK and abroad,
making a difference to the things you care about. It&rsquo;s an open and relaxed space to talk with good friends &mdash; it&rsquo;s
qualifications and badges and awards. It&rsquo;s the freedom to do what makes you happy. </p>
<p>Rangers is what you make of it. Whether you&rsquo;re just joining or have been in Girlguiding for years, Rangers gives you
  the chance to focus on the things you love and care about, to be more independent, and to challenge yourself. You
  might want to design an app, or make an animation or vlog, or learn a new sport, or start a petition, or trace your
  family tree, or connect with nature. You might want to become a volunteer camping leader or first-aider or young
  leader. You might want to work towards a Duke of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Award or join our Advocate Panel. You might just want to
  relax with your Ranger friends, sharing thoughts and stories and dreams. The possibilities are many, and the choices
  are all yours.</p>
