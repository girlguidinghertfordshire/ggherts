<p>There are many ways to say thank you, and to acknowledge all that is done within guiding, including <a
    href="#county">county</a>, <a href="#region">region</a> and <a href="#national">national</a> awards.</p>

<p>These recognise and reward the work that our volunteers and members do which is over and beyond their roles in
  Girlguiding Hertfordshire.</p>

<p>Our awards are open to all and fully inclusive. Nominations can be made by our volunteers, members, girls, and
  parents.</p>

<p>Do you know someone in your district, division or county who is special, and you feel deserves recognition for what
  they do or have done for guiding in Hertfordshire? Why not nominate them for a formal award.</p>
