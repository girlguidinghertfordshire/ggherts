<p>There are many ways to say thank you, and to acknowledge all that is done within guiding, including <a href="#county">County</a>, <a href="#region">Region</a> and <a href="#national">National</a> awards.</p>

<p>These recognise and reward the work that our volunteers and members do which is over and beyond their roles in Girlguiding Hertfordshire.</p>

<p>Our awards are open to all and fully inclusive.  Nominations can be made by our volunteers, members, girls, and parents.</p>

<p>Do you know someone in your district, division or county who is special, and you feel deserves recognition for what they do or have done for Guiding in Hertfordshire?  Why not nominate them for a formal award.</p>

<p>Congratulations to our 2023 award recipients.</p>
<p>The celebration event for award recipients, their guests and VIPS took place in September at our County Centre in Cottered.  A wonderful time was had by all and due to the beautiful weather, we were fortunate to be able to hold the event outdoors.</p>
