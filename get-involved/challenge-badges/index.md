  <h2 id="marathon">Marathon Challenge Badge</h2>
  The Walking Team is excited to announce a brand new Challenge badge to link in with the Olympics. Anyone can participate, <img class="wp-image-4024 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-Marathon-Challenge.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="166" />member or non-member, so families can go out and exercise together and everyone can have fun earning the badge.

  The Challenge is to walk or run a marathon - that's 42km - which even at 2-3km a day is quickly achievable. The reward for your efforts is a lovely bright badge in the Olympic colours. The Challenge will run for the whole of 2021 so for those who can do more, there's a different coloured badge for each marathon you complete, to make up the 5 Olympic rings.

  To help you keep a record of your progress, you might like to use one of the following:

  To make your daily walks more fun, follow the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hertsguideswalkingteam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Herts Guides Walking Team Facebook page</a> where different activity ideas are posted regularly

  If you're doing the mini challenges you might like to take a fantasy creature or toy out with you on your walks and photograph it next to the things you find. You can create a  'fantasy forage' scrapbook or digital photo album. You'll see my little owl on our Facebook page as he comes with me on my walks.

  However you choose to do your Marathon Challenge, have fun.
