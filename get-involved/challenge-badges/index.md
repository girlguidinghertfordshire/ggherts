The Walking Team Marathon Badge Challenge will continue into 2022, to allow us to celebrate and be inspired by the Winter Olympics & Winter Para Olympics.  Anyone can participate, member or non-member, so families can go out and exercise together and everyone can have fun earning the badge.

The Challenge is to walk, use a wheelchair, or run a marathon - that’s 42km - which even at 2-3km a day is quickly achievable. The reward for your efforts is a lovely bright badge in the Olympic colours. For those who can do more, there’s a different coloured badge for each marathon you complete  (up to 5 in total), to make up the Olympic rings.

To help you keep a record of your progress, you might like to use one of the following:
