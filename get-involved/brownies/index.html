          <p>Brownies is about getting together regularly - often each week - to work on <a href="https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/what-we-do/our-badges-and-activities/badge-finder/?SearchForm.Text=&SearchForm.GuidingSectionId=54&SearchForm.TypeId=&SearchForm.ThemeId=&SearchForm.PageNumber=1&SearchForm.Order=Relevance" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">badges</a>, learn new skills, play games and see friends. It's about trying adventurous activities and going along to special events, day trips, sleepovers, camps and holidays.</p>
            <p>All Brownies are sure to try new things and take on a broad range of challenges. They work together to explore the world around them and make a positive difference in their community. </p>
