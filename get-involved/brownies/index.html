<p><img src="/assets/images/core/brownie-badge.webp" alt="New Brownie badge" class="float-md-end ps-3 pb-3" loading="lazy" /><div class="clearfix d-md-none"></div>It&rsquo;s full of firsts: they might grow their first plant, cook their first cake, put up (and take down) their first
  tent, light their first fire, go on their first fun-packed weekend away with guiding friends.</p>
<p>With a helpful hand from our encouraging volunteers, they'll explore their creative side, get out into the great
  outdoors, and start learning to look after themselves, others and the world we live in.</p>
<p>They can build their own Brownie adventure &mdash; they might just want to have fun with their friends; they might like to
  work towards the many badges and awards we offer. They can have a go at all sorts of things: from making a robot to
  exploring mindfulness to putting on a magic show. There&rsquo;s something for every girl at Brownies, and plenty of moments
  they&rsquo;ll never forget.</p>

<p>In advance, speak with their <strong>current unit
    leader</strong> about available local opportunities. There might not be a place for them straight away, so they may
  have to be added to your chosen unit&rsquo;s waiting list. It is therefore advisable to make enquiries as soon as
  possible.</p>
