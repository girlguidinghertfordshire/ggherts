<h3>Lone Guiding Volunteers</h3>
As a county we want to reach as many girls as possible to enable them to have the opportunities and fun that we all have access to. Some girls (and indeed adults) can't attend weekly meetings for a number of reasons but this shouldn't be a hurdle. Girlguiding has a "Lone Guiding" solution which we would like to be able to offer.

Many of us have had an insight into the world of virtual or distance meetings and have learnt to adapt activities and resources accordingly. This gives us a great starting point.

We are looking for a volunteer or team of volunteers to continue with Lone Guiding after the face to face meetings resume. This role will include:
<ul>
 	<li>organising activities</li>
 	<li>regular communication with members</li>
 	<li>unit administration on GO</li>
 	<li>finances of the unit</li>
 	<li>recruitment</li>
</ul>
Full role description will follow.

If you are interested in getting involved please contact the county office: <a href="mailto:countysec@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countysec@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk</a>
