<h2>Current Volunteer Vacancies</h2>
We have a fantastic team of volunteers who look to the County Team for guidance, support and vision. As part of this County Team structure we are looking for new advisers to help the County to move forward and be the best that we can be.  All members of the team need to fully embrace the programme and spread passion and enthusiasm for guiding.

<h3 class="clearfix">Growth &amp; Retention Working Team</h3>
The Growth &amp; Retention Group are looking for new members to join the team.

We would like to have members from a range of volunteer roles as well as members from different areas of the county and are looking for people who are enthusiastic and would like to make a difference to the future of Girlguiding Hertfordshire.

Please <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Growth-and-Retention-Team-Role-Desc.pdf">click here</a> for a role description or for more information/to get involved contact Sally Settle, Assistant County Commissioner - Members: <a href="mailto:sallyACC@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sallyACC@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk</a>
<h3>Lone Guiding Volunteers</h3>
As a county we want to reach as many girls as possible to enable them to have the opportunities and fun that we all have access to. Some girls (and indeed adults) can't attend weekly meetings for a number of reasons but this shouldn't be a hurdle. Girlguiding has a "Lone Guiding" solution which we would like to be able to offer.

Many of us have had an insight into the world of virtual or distance meetings and have learnt to adapt activities and resources accordingly. This gives us a great starting point.

We are looking for a volunteer or team of volunteers to continue with Lone Guiding after the face to face meetings resume. This role will include:
<ul>
 	<li>organising activities</li>
 	<li>regular communication with members</li>
 	<li>unit administration on GO</li>
 	<li>finances of the unit&lt;</li>
 	<li>recruitment</li>
</ul>
Full role description will follow.

If you are interested in getting involved please contact the county office: <a href="mailto:countysec@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countysec@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk</a>
