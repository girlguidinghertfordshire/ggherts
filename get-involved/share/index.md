Our media and communications team would love to hear about what you, your unit, district, division or Trefoil Guild have been up to, and share your stories on our county social media platforms to celebrate your successes and inspire others to try new challenges and ideas.

You can submit your story to <communications@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>. Please send us your article wording together with photographs and relevant photo permissions.

## Photos

![Mobile phones take great photos. Email each photo separately so it is not condensed in size.](/assets/images/2024/04/photos.webp){:.d-block.mx-auto.mb-2}
Photos may be cropped/edited/deleted where permissions are not provided.  
  
## Photo Permissions

Every adult featured in a photograph, will need to submit their consent, either via the online Girlguiding
Hertfordshire individual photo consent form or by completing and signing the Word version of the form. This form can
also be completed by a parent/guardian/carer to provide consent for their child aged under 14.

Where groups of girls feature in photographs, a Girlguiding Hertfordshire group photo consent form should be completed
by a leader, either via the online form or using the Word version of the form, confirming all girls have already
provided their full photo consent.

The links for the photo consent forms, both online and Word versions can be found on the [resources page](/about-us/resources/#photoconsent).
