<h3 class="bg-light-blue my-2 p-3">Flexible Guiding</h3>
<p>In addition to the normal unit offerings we are pleased to inform you that Girlguiding Hertfordshire also has Flexible Guiding Units. This means we can offer all the benefits of being a Girlguiding member in a way that fits around your needs and schedule. For more details please visit the <a href="https://www.girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk/flexible-guiding-units/">Flexible Guiding Units webpage.</a> </p>
<h3 class="bg-light-blue my-2 p-3">The next step in her guiding journey</h3>
<p>When your daughter becomes old enough, she'll be able to move up into the next section of Girlguiding.</p>
<p>Here's a guide to when it might happen:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rainbows move up to Brownies aged 7</li>
  <li>Brownies move up to Guides aged 10</li>
  <li>Guides move up to Rangers aged 14</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="bg-light-blue my-1 p-2">How to move your daughter on</h3>
<p>In advance of your daughter's time to move on to the next section, speak with their <strong>current unit leader</strong> about available local opportunities. There might not be a place for them straight away, so they may have to be added to your chosen unit&rsquo;s waiting list. It is therefore advisable to make enquiries as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 class="bg-light-blue h1"><img src="/assets/images/core/adult.webp" alt="" class="img-fluid m-3">Volunteers</h2>
<p><strong>Ages 18 plus</strong></p>
<p>There are thousands of adult volunteers who help within Girlguiding in so many ways, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Running a unit as a leader, assistant leader or helper</li>
  <li>Helping with the accounts or administration</li>
  <li>Teaching skills such as First Aid, or adventurous activities like sailing or climbing and units will often welcome support</li>
  <li>Supporting one of the local Girlguiding volunteer shops and depots</li>
  <li>Carry out gardening or DIY at a local site</li>
  <li>Fundraising for trips and special events</li>
