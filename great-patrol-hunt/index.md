## The History of the Great Patrol Hunt&#8230;

It began in 1968, Hertfordshire Scout Patrols competed annually in various ways, in what became known as Great Patrol Hunt. In 1972, Guide Patrols were admitted to the competitions and many of them entered the first round, the rest is history! Today, Great Patrol Hunt is more popular than ever because the challenges offer patrols the opportunity to do activities that are fun, out of the ordinary and inspiring.

## Competition Rules

Teams need not be regular weekly Patrols, but they must choose a unique name for themselves in order to enter. Patrols <strong>must consist of 4-6 Guides</strong> and should not include more than 10 different patrol members throughout the three rounds. To participate in Round 3, a patrol and at least 2 members must have competed in one of the previous rounds. </em><em>If you are unable to make a full Patrol in Rounds 1 &amp; 2,  then  join the &#8216;GPH Mavericks&#8217;, a patrol made of Guides from different units.</em></p>
