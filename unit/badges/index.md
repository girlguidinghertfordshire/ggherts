## External charity badges

### Chalk Stream challenge badge

![Chalk Stream badge](/assets/images/2025/06/chalk-stream-challenge-badge.webp){:.float-end.ms-3.mb-3}
This challenge badge encourages young people to explore and learn about rare and important chalk stream habitats.

Chalk Streams are often described as ‘England’s Rainforest’ because across the country we have 85% of this global total with 10% of these rare habitats being located in Hertfordshire. They provide rare spaces for a whole host of wonderful creatures and plants to live in harmony with each other. Like water voles, brown trout, damsel and dragonflies, water crowfoot and mayflies.

You can choose your own local chalk stream or use the pre-existing route guides to explore:

- The River Chess near Chesham (created by The Chalk Stream Project).
- The River Mimram, part of Panshanger Park near Hertford (route created by Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust) .

The downloadable resources, including route maps, activity suggestions, spotter guides and stream facts can be found on the Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust’s website: <https://www.hertswildlifetrust.org.uk/chalk-stream-challenge>{:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} (at the very bottom of the page) and the Chilterns Chalk Streams Project website: (<https://www.chilternstreams.org/learning/community-groups/chalk-stream-challenge-badge/>{:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}).

This challenge is flexible and suitable for all guiding sections.

Badges cost £1.00 each (plus postage) and you can also download a certificate of completion.
