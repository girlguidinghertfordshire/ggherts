## Division badges

### Chippy hike badge

![Chippy hike badge](/assets/images/2025/11/chippy-badge.webp){:.ms-3.mb-3.float-end}
This is a fun badge, created by St Albans division, born out of many years of units getting out and about.

However you want to run your chippy hike is totally down to you, so long as you walk to a chip shop and eat chips you can earn your badge!

There are many UMA’s / skills builders that involve getting out and exploring your local area – why not plan yours to end up at the chippy.

Different sections can do different lengths of hike – for example Guides may walk 3 miles to earn their chips, whilst getting Rainbows safely across the road and back to the unit meeting place without dropping their chips is a success!

If you have access to more than 1 chippy you can rate the chips from each on a number of criteria from 1 to 5. Criteria could include colour, smell, crunch, texture, taste etc. Older members might want to also rate value for money, length of wait to be served or getting their chips, and customer service, as some examples. Tally up the scores and award the best chippy a badge.

There are also UMA’s/ Skills Builders that involve taste tests.

Badges are £1 each plus postage and packaging.

### Chalk Stream challenge badge

![Chalk Stream badge](/assets/images/2025/06/chalk-stream-challenge-badge.webp){:.float-end.ms-3.mb-3}
This challenge badge encourages young people to explore and learn about rare and important chalk stream habitats.

Chalk Streams are often described as ‘England’s Rainforest’ because across the country we have 85% of this global total with 10% of these rare habitats being located in Hertfordshire. They provide rare spaces for a whole host of wonderful creatures and plants to live in harmony with each other. Like water voles, brown trout, damsel and dragonflies, water crowfoot and mayflies.

You can choose your own local chalk stream or use the pre-existing route guides to explore:

- The River Chess near Chesham (created by The Chalk Stream Project).
- The River Mimram, part of Panshanger Park near Hertford (route created by Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust) .

The downloadable resources, including route maps, activity suggestions, spotter guides and stream facts can be found on the Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust’s website: <https://www.hertswildlifetrust.org.uk/chalk-stream-challenge>{:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} (at the very bottom of the page) and the Chilterns Chalk Streams Project website: (<https://www.chilternstreams.org/learning/community-groups/chalk-stream-challenge-badge/>{:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}).

This challenge is flexible and suitable for all guiding sections.

Badges cost £1.00 each (plus postage) and you can also download a certificate of completion.
