The Commonwealth award was open to Guides aged 13+ and Rangers, young leaders and adult members aged 18-25.

Girlguiding retired this Award in 2024, but anyone who had already started it has until 1 December 2025 to complete it and our county Commonwealth Award lead volunteer, contactable by email on commonwealth@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk, will continue to provide support.

You can find out more about why the decision was made to retire this Award on the [Girlguidingâ€™s Commonwealth award webpage.](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/what-we-do/our-badges-and-activities/badge-finder/commonwealth-award/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}

For advice and support to those considering or already undertaking the Commonwealth award and their local leadership team please contact the county Commonwealth award lead volunteer on <commonwealth@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>.
