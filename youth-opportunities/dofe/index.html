The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award (DofE) is a voluntary, non-competitive programme of activities, open to anyone aged 14
    to 24, or aged 13 and in the school year they turn 14.</p>

<p>The DofE programme operates in over 100 countries, and whilst being a fun challenge to undertake, it is also
    recognised by potential employers and universities as an achievement and mark of personal development. The programme
    is balanced and develops the whole person - mind, body and soul - in an environment of social interaction and
    teamwork.</p>

<p>Most participants start with their Bronze Award, but you can start at any level, even Gold (subject to minimum age
    restrictions).</p>

<p>Girlguiding has joined forces with DofE so you can complete this fantastic challenge as part of your guiding
    experience. Within Girlguiding Hertfordshire we run a programme of expedition training, practice and qualifying expeditions for Bronze and Silver levels.</p>

<p> Details of any forthcoming <a href="/events/">Bronze and Silver DofE events and expeditions</a> will be advertised on the
    county's event webpage.</p>

<p>Those wishing to undertake their Gold DofE Award should contact Anglia region on <a href="mailto:angliadofe@girlguiding-anglia.org.uk">angliadofe@girlguiding-anglia.org.uk</a></p>
