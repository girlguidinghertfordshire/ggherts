    The Duke of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Award (DofE) is a voluntary, non-competitive programme of activities, open to anyone
    aged 14 to 24, or aged 13 and in Year 9 at school.</p>

<p>The DofE programme operates in over 100 countries, and whilst being a fun challenge to undertake, it is also
    recognised by potential employers and universities as an achievement and mark of personal development. The programme
    is balanced and develops the whole person - mind, body and soul - in an environment of social interaction and
    teamwork.</p>

<p>Girlguiding has joined forces with DofE so you can complete this fantastic challenge as part of your guiding
    experience. Details of any forthcoming <a href="/events/">events and expeditions</a> will be advertised on the county website's.</p>
