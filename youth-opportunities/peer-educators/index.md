Calling all our 14-25 year old members - would you like to make a difference as a peer educator?

You will be trained how to create a safe space for girls to discuss subjects like self-esteem, mental wellbeing and challenging gender stereotypes. You will visit units and run activities which teach invaluable life tools.
