## The road to launch #InspireHertfordshire

{:.text-muted}
September 2023

Hello all, my name is Amy and I am the Herts Inspire lead volunteer.  

What is Inspire? Firstly, there isn’t an easy quick answer to that question, but I like to think of it as: whatever we want it to be. If you checkout the [girlguiding.org.uk page](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/what-we-do/inspire/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}, some of the key words to describe Inspire are ‘fun, flexible and tailored to you.’ Using this as a starting point, it is my mission to build a community with you, 18–30-year-olds of Hertfordshire, where we can try new things and do what we love in guiding. However, our main responsibility as members of Inspire, is making sure we have the best time together and are doing something that we can all reflect back on with a smile.  

In Girlguiding I am a Ranger leader in Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire counties. Whether or not you are part of a unit, I’m sure we can agree that everything needed to make a unit work doesn’t materialise overnight. It takes time to build a successful group, with trust, teamwork, a bit of trial and error and enthusiasm. I like to think of Inspire being similar. The roadmap graphic gives you an idea of what is happening behind the scenes to make Inspire what we want it to be.

### Information gathering

The first part in our roadmap is where I am hoping to get some direction from you. I am only one person and I definitely do not claim to have all the answers about what you may want to do. Over the next few weeks and months, I am hoping to gather lots of ideas about what I can organise that would excite you and make you want to be a part of Inspire Hertfordshire.  You can help me by completing the online questionnaire.

[Start questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-s-2IJR_caRUmM53KxQx3VHgwLaY1KGs-Sv7OhYytvScXtw/viewform?usp=sf_link){:.external-link.btn.btn-primary}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}

Please keep your eyes peeled for other surveys and questionnaire which will be your chance to collaborate with me and work out a fun plan of virtual and in person activities.

### Scheduling

Sometimes, I can get very excited about things and then want to do everything at once. When I came back to Girlguiding in 2021 I decided that I would do my Commonwealth award, leadership qualification and Queen’s Guide award all at the same time. This was a challenge, to say the least, but a lesson I learnt is that scheduling is very important. Doing everything all at once is not necessarily the best route to enjoy what you are doing.

After data collection, the next step is working out when we can meet and start having fun. I realise that we’re all at different stages in our lives and have assorted interests fighting for a slot in our busy calendars. Therefore, to make Inspire something for everyone I think there needs to be flexibility. There is no expectation that you will have to attend every meeting, it would be impossible to pick dates we can all be available for. One of my ideas is to have a virtual meeting one month, and then an in-person meeting the next. Part of the [1st questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-s-2IJR_caRUmM53KxQx3VHgwLaY1KGs-Sv7OhYytvScXtw/viewform?usp=sf_link){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} is establishing best days, times and format for meetings so I can create a list of ‘save the dates’ for Inspire gatherings.

Whilst Hertfordshire is a small county, we have a very dense population. In terms of numbers, we are actually the 2nd largest Girlguiding county. For our in-person meetups, as well as visits outside the county for example to London or Cambridge, I would like to aim to meet in each of our 9 geographical divisions.  I’m based in West division so have some local ideas, but please let me know about places near you. A meeting location doesn’t have to be a Guide Hut, it could be adventurous, or it could be calm and cosy.

### Marketing

What is Inspire? What could Inspire be? These are questions that float about in my mind a lot and I could imagine the former may have passed through yours too. Inspire did not have the easiest of beginnings, originally it was due to launch during early 2020, but we all know what happened then. The marketing section of the roadmap exists to ensure everyone hears about the planned exciting schedule of activities. Part of the Inspire Hertfordshire journey is creating a memorable brand that is exciting.  Towards the end of the 1st questionnaire, you should see some sections asking about what sort of Inspire merchandise you would like. I’m sure you’ll agree it wouldn’t be a Girlguiding group if there weren’t any badges. It is part of my plan to have consistency across any virtual, printed or media content. Please share any ideas that you have, collaboration is key to build something that you want.

### Launching

At the end of the road, or the light at the end of the tunnel, is launching Inspire Hertfordshire. As it stands this is planned for early 2024. Something to look forward to. I hope this summary of what is happening behind the scenes has made you curious and excited about what Inspire Hertfordshire could be. If you have any ideas or would like to have a chat about Inspire, feel free to send me a message on <inspire@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>

Thank you.

Amy
