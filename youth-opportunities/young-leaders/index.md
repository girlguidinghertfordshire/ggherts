If you are aged 14-17 and are interested in working alongside a team of volunteers planning and running weekly meetings for girls whilst learning new skills, having fun and making new friends, the young leader role is perfect for you.

You can choose to volunteer with Rainbows, Brownies or Guides or even a mix of groups.

You do not need to have been a Girlguiding member previously or done any volunteering before to become a young leader.

If you are already a Guide or Ranger you should speak to your unit leader and they will help you move to being a young leader.  If you’re not yet 14, you could become a Rainbow or Brownie helper instead until you are old enough for the young leader role.

If you are not already a Girlguiding member you can register via the [Girlguiding UK website](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/get-involved/become-a-volunteer/register-to-volunteer/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} and a local volunteer will contact you.

Young leaders can develop their skills further by undertaking the young leader development programme which is made up of 12 modules.  You can find out more about what this involves on the [Girlguiding UK website.](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/information-for-volunteers/learning-and-development/young-leader-development-programme/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}
