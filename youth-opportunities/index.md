Welcome to the new Youth Opportunities webpage which we hope will support and assist leaders, 13+ Guides, Rangers and Young Leaders.  The newly formed county Youth Opportunities Team are here to support YOU and have created a new newsletter providing information and articles from all the advisers within this team and their plans and current opportunities.

## Events

Watch out here, for further information of events aimed specifically at this age group which we will put out there as soon as we are allowed to meet up safely again.

Young Leaders can also find information on the [Girlguiding Anglia's website](https://www.girlguiding-anglia.org.uk/young-leader-opportunities){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} about various opportunities available.

## Young Leader and Young Leader Qualification Registration Process

Following a review of the use of the Young Leader form it has been decided that it is no longer needed.  For more details on adding the YL role to GO and how the YLQ can be registered please visit the [Member System Updates page May 2021 section](/membership-system-updates/2021/#may-2021).

## Leader in Training

If you think you might enjoy running your own unit you can work towards becoming a leader once you turn 16.  You will need to hold a Leader in Training role in order to commence the Becoming a Leader training, which forms part of the Leader Development Programme.

You can find out all you need to know about becoming a leader on the [Girlguiding UK website](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/learning-and-development/leadership-skills/become-a-girlguiding-leader/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} and instructions on how to register as a Leader in Training can be found below.

## Inspire

You may be wondering, what is Inspire? Inspire is the Girlguiding offering for all 18-30 year olds. It doesn’t matter what your everyday role or level of interaction with Girlguiding is, all members within this age range are automatically part of Inspire. It is a place where you can make new friends, learn new skills and take advantage of the many awards and opportunities on offer. This can include completing Girlguiding qualifications and awards such as the Queens Guide award or Duke of Edinburgh Award, volunteering at events in the future, making your voice heard as a Girlguiding advocate, developing new skills or helping to train other members and share your knowledge and experience.
