If you have received notification that your Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check is expiring, or you are a new volunteer requiring a DBS check, come along on **Sunday 12 May** to our clinic and we can carry out your DBS check.

[Book your time slot](https://forms.office.com/e/N7aRKQs74n){:.btn.btn-primary.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}

After you have completed the form, you will receive an email from the DBS system which will allow you to select which identity documents you will bring with you on the day, as well as an email confirming the location.
