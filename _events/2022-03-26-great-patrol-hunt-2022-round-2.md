The Great Patrol Hunt 2022 Round 2 is taking place on Saturday 26th March 2022 at St Albans.

If you would like to enter a team please complete the entry form.  You will also need to complete an Information and Consent form for **each** Guide.  All the details you need to complete your entry are on the entry form.

## Enter round 2

[Round 2 Entry Form <i class="fa fa-download"></i>](/assets/docs/2022/gph-entry-form-round-2-2022.docx){:rel="noreferrer noopener"}{:class="btn-gg"} [Round 2 Information and Consent <i class="fa fa-download"></i>](/assets/docs/2022/gph-i-c-form-r2-2022.docx){:rel="noreferrer noopener"}{:class="btn-gg"}

Haven’t got enough to make up a team?  Don’t worry you can still send an entry even if you only have one guide interested and we can match them with other small entries to make up one of our mixed teams.  They will still have a great time and get to make new friends.

Leaders are not required to accompany Patrols to this event, which is run by a team of qualified Girlguiding leaders, however if you would like to offer your help, please let us know.  New leaders are always more than welcome.
