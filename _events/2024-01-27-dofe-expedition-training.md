This weekend, taking place in Colney Heath, is for all those in school year 9 or above who are registered, or interested, in taking part in DofE expeditions through Girlguiding in 2024.

All the main areas of Bronze expedition training will be covered, and in relation to Silver DofE you will learn to use eDofE and OS maps and plan your practice expedition, revise higher level navigation skills, first aid, food and expedition aims.

It will be a great opportunity for participants to meet the other members of their future expedition teams.

Cost: Â£50 (includes accommodation, food and resources).  

For more information or to book a place please contact the county DofE Award lead volunteer on <dofe@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>

More information about DofE within Girlguiding can also be found on our [DofE page](/youth-opportunities/dofe/).

**If you are unable to meet these dates, please advise the [county DofE Award lead volunteer](mailto:dofe@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk) as soon as possible so that other counties can be contacted to see what opportunities they have available.**
