Come along on Monday 15 September to help get our county centre in Cottered clean and ready for reopening very soon, following completion of phase 1 building works.

This is the perfect opportunity to see for yourself the changes and improvements made so far and be part of this refurbishment project.

The day will run from 10am - 4pm but you can join us at any time.

Tea/coffee and treats provided but please bring your own lunch if you'll be with us for the lunchtime period.

Contact <HGCchair@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> to let us know to expect you.
