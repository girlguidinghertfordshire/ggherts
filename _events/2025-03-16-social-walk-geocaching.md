Join the walking team from 10am on Sunday 16 March in, and around, Old Welwyn searching for geocaches whilst enjoying a 5 mile (approx.) spring walk.

Whether you are a seasoned cacher, or looking to expand your horizons, please come along.

You can download the app, or use it if you have it already, on your phone or device. Alternatively, we have a couple of GPs devices you can use during this social walk. There will also be tips and advice for taking your own girls out on a geocaching adventure.

Email <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> for further information and to book your space.

Adults only.
