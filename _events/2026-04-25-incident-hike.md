Guides and Rangers are invited to join the county walking team on this exciting incident hike in Mardley Heath, Welwyn on Sunday 26 April.

Teams will navigate a set route (approximately 10k in length), completing problem-solving bases at intervals along the way and show how well they can work as a team.

Teams will consist of 4-6 Guides with or without their leaders (based on navigation competence) and Ranger teams of 4-6 girls.

More details about this fun and exciting challenge will follow soon, but in the meantime please save the date and start getting your teams organised.
