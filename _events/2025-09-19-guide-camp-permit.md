Love going on camps or holidays with your unit?

Ever thought about being the one in charge of the trip?

With the Guide camp permit (for Guides) and Lead Away permit (for Rangers and young leaders), you can be the one who plans and runs an awesome camping adventure for your friends!

These permits are a great way to:

- Build your camping and outdoor skills
- Boost your confidence and leadership
- Take your friends on a 2-night (or longer) camping trip
- Show off your skills with a real qualification

You can take a group of 4 - 8 people (including yourself), and you'll learn everything you need to know to make it fun, safe and unforgettable. Only 1 member within the group can complete their qualification during this weekend.

The camp permit and Lead Away permit assessment weekend is taking place from **Friday 19 - Sunday 21 September** at **Hertfordshire Guide Centre, Cottered** for Guides, Ranger and young leaders.

As part of your assessment you will need to plan, budget, create a menu and organise activities for this weekend.

Register for a place by **Saturday 19 July.**
