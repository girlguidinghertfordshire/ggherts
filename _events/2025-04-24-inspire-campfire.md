Join the [county Inspire team](/youth-opportunities/inspire/) online on Thursday 24 April for a virtual campfire from 7pm - 8.30pm (approx).

Get ready to gather around the digital flames with fellow Girlguiding Inspire members from within Hertfordshire.

This online campfire will be filled with fun activities, songs, and stories to inspire and connect us all. So grab your marshmallows and join us for a cozy evening of friendship and fun.

Don't miss out on this unique opportunity to bond with your guiding sisters in a whole new way. See you at the campfire!

The Teams link will be emailed to those who have signed up to join, nearer the date.
