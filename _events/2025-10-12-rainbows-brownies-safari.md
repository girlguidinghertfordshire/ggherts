Bring your Rainbows or Brownies to complete their Nature Walk badge in the lovely Broxbourne Woods with Herts Guides walking team on **Sunday 12 October.**

This is an easy-walking circular route on good paths through woodland. Girls will complete multiple activities at points along the way which will involve using their 5 senses and immersing themselves in nature.

The day will start and finish at Broxbourne Woods East car park. Car sharing is strongly requested as the car park is small. We will operate a ‘kiss and fly’ drop off and pick up system, with the girls being safely gathered into their unit groups.

Starting times will be staggered from 9.30am - 11am and the event will take around 2 hours to complete. Groups will be given their start time once they have registered for the event.

Cost: **£2 per girl,** includes all activities and event badge.

To book you place, please complete the booking form and return it to the walking team by **Friday 26 September** to <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> with the subject ‘Sensory Safari’.

At least one leader from each unit must attend with their girls, additional ‘ratio adults’ can be parent helpers. The usual Girlguiding outdoor ratios apply as per [Girlguiding website.](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/information-for-volunteers/running-your-unit/safeguarding-and-risk/adult-to-child-ratios/#:~:text=Trips%20outside%20your%20usual%20meeting%20space%20must%20have%3A,Rangers%3A%201%20leader%20with%20a%20recommended%20second%20adult.){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}

Information and consent forms, which can be downloaded below, will be required for this activity and must be completed for all members aged under 18 who are attending.

Leaders are responsible for their own unit's permission forms and should bring them to the event.

Units will need to arrange their own home emergency contact.

Final leader information will be emailed 2 weeks prior to the event.

**Please note:**

- There are no public toilets at this venue, so it is recommended that girls go to the loo before leaving home.
- The ‘sensory’ trail will include smelling and tasting a few fruits and herbs. Whilst girls are under unit leaders’ direct care, we would request that any allergies be listed on the booking form
