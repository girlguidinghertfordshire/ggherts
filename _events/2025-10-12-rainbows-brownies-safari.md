Open to Rainbows and Brownies on the morning of Sunday 12 October.

Participants will use their 5 senses to discover nature along the woodland trail in Broxbourne Woods.

Each group of up to 12 rainbows, or 16 brownies, (plus their 2 accompanying adults) will take 2 hours to complete the trail, stopping frequently to enjoy activities.

Groups will be given a start time once they have registered for the event.

All participants will receive a lovely ‘Nature Walk’ badge. Cost per participant £2.

Register for either event by emailing <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>
