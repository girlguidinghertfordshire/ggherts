Adults, Young Leaders & Rangers are welcome to join the Walking Team on a social walk in the Lee Valley Park starting at 2pm on Saturday 5th March until approximately 4pm. 

We will be discovering some of the giant sculptures installed at the time of the London Olympics. You can just 'walk & talk' or practice your map reading skills if you wish to. 

No charge.

To book a place please email <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>
