## A great opportunity for an adventure!

Buntingford Guides invite you to join their checkpoint hike and camp weekend, setting off from Cottered on Saturday 17 May.

Guides will walk in patrols (of 4 to 7 members) under remote supervision, going from checkpoint to checkpoint. They will be given maps and grid points to plot which will be checked before they begin the hike. There will be a pre-hike kit check, including compass. They will be out all day, taking their own packed lunch, drinks and plenty of snacks.

After the day’s hike, they will return to Hertfordshire Guide Centre base camp where they will put up their own tent and cook their own meal on a lightweight stove.

Patrols will need to bring a tent and a gas Trangia (or similar, but no briefcase style stoves or meths stoves please). All food will be provided.  

There will be an evening campfire, where groups will each lead a song, as well as a movie in the camp shelter. Breakfast on Sunday will be provided.

Each patrol will need to bring an adult, who will be allocated to help either at base or on a check point. The event will be non-competitive and leaders will be encouraged to help the Guides while they develop their skills – just not to do everything for them. Each unit attending will need to complete a REN.

The cost of the weekend will be in the region of £30 per participant.

The downloadable flyer can be printed or emailed for you to advertise this event to your Guides.

Please contact Anna, initially by email at <hikeandcampweekend@gmail.com> to express your interest or ask any questions.
