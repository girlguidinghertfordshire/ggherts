Our Inspire community (ages 18 - 30) are invited to join our county Inspire team for a Halloween themed, fun-filled autumn day at the farm on Sunday 19 October at Church Farm, Ardeley, from 10am - 3pm*. There'll be animal care, apple picking, horticultural jobs and outdoor time socialising with friends.

Afterwards, why not enjoy a drink in the pub before heading to the spooky woodland walk at 4:15pm? It’s a Halloween adventure that’s brilliant fun for adults too!

Badges will be available!

Don’t miss this chance to celebrate autumn, connect with others, and have some spooky fun!

Email <inspireadmin@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> to book your place.

*If you can't make it during our main session (10am - 3pm) you can join later, just let us know that's your plan.
