Are you a young leader requiring support with your YLQ or YLDP, have questions you need answered or would like to make connections with other young leaders?

Our county young leader lead volunteer is holding an **online** (Teams) drop in session for young leaders on **Wednesday 23 October** from **7 - 9pm.**

If you would like to 'drop in' or register interest to attend, please email <yl@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> and provide your name and GO membership number.  

Our county young leader lead volunteer will then provide the Teams link to join the drop in session nearer the date.

Please would leaders pass details of this online drop in session to any young leaders in their units.
