This indoor expedition training weekend is for anyone who is planning to undertake a Practice or Assessed Duke of Edinburgh's Expedition with Girlguiding Hertfordshire during 2023.  

It will cover all the main areas of training for **Bronze** and **Silver** Expeditions and will also revise higher level navigation skills, first aid, expedition aims etc.

This is a great opportunity for participants to meet the other members of their future expedition teams.

**Cost** – £50 (*includes* accommodation, food and resources)

If you are unable to meet these dates please contact the county DofE adviser on <dofe@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> to discuss.

More information about DofE within Girlguiding can also be found on our [DofE page.](/youth-opportunities/dofe/)
