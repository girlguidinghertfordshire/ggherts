Why not come along to Welwyn Garden City on the morning of Sunday 24 March with your unit, or family, and join the walking team for an eggâ€™citing Easter egg hunt.

Setting off from Guessens Guide Hut, with staggered start times, the hunt is expected to take 1.5 - 2 hours approximately.

With a spring in your step, keep your eyes peeled and solve the clues!

The perfect way to get in the mood for Easter.

All sections and ages welcome.

For further information or to book email <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>

Happy hunting!
