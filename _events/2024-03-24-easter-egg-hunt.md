Open to both families and units.

Why not come along to Welwyn Garden City on Sunday 24 March with your unit, or family, and join the walking team for an egg’citing Easter egg hunt.

Setting off from Guessens Guide Hut at 11am, with staggered start times, the hunt is expected to take 1.5 - 2 hours approximately around the streets of Welwyn Garden City.

With a spring in your step, keep your eyes peeled and solve the clues!

Trail sheets and pencils will be supplied. Find the laminated eggs, solve the anagram and you will be rewarded with a chocolate egg.

The perfect way to get in the mood for Easter.

All sections and ages welcome.

£1 each.

For further information or to book email <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>

Happy hunting!
