Round 3 of this year’s Great Patrol Hunt Guide competition, is taking place from **6pm on Friday 21 - 12pm Sunday 23 June 2024** at Wymondley Wood.  This is a camping round and accommodation will be in tents.

Patrols must consist of 4-6 Guides (aged 10-15 years old and a member of a Guide unit for each round they complete in), and should not include more than 10 different members throughout the 3 rounds.

To participate in round 3, the final stage of the competition, either a patrol and at least 2 members must have competed in one of the previous rounds, or a new patrol must be accompanied by one of its unit leaders.

Girls who were part of a GPH 'Maverick' patrol in either of the previous 2 rounds are eligible to apply for round 3, and if they are still not a full team, we will again match them up.

Cost: **£25 per person.**

**Entry form** together with **payment,** completed **information and consent forms** and **health forms** must be submitted by **Friday 24 May.** Please note, separate information and consent forms and health forms must be submitted for each individual attending.

Places are allocated on a first come, first served basis. On acceptance of your entry patrol instructions will be emailed to the unit leader, after the closing date.
