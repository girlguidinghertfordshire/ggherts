Bring your older Brownies, Guides, Rangers and adult teams to complete 10k over 10 of London’s most iconic bridges with the Herts walking team on **Sunday 21 September 2025.**

This is a flat, linear walk on good paths along London’s riverside and bridges, completing a treasure hunt along the way.

The day will start (registration 10-11am) at Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, which is located a couple of minutes walk from Vauxhall station. The event will finish on the grassed area in front of the Bridge Theatre, 3 Potters Fields Park, London, SE1 2SG.

Participants are responsible for getting themselves/their groups to and from the start and finish points. There are good public transport networks to and from London.

Starting times will be slightly staggered from 10am and the route will take at least 5 hours to complete, possibly longer with the younger age groups.

Payment of **£2 per participant** is required on booking and includes an event badge. It **does not** include participant travel expenses. Leaders are responsible for arranging transport for their group and completing the relevant risk assessments etc associated with that travel.

Bookings for this event are now closed.

At least one qualified leader from each unit must attend with their girls, plus other accompanying adults (these can be parent helpers), in line with the [Girlguiding ratios.](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/information-for-volunteers/running-your-unit/safeguarding-and-risk/adult-to-child-ratios/#:~:text=Trips%20outside%20your%20usual%20meeting%20space%20must%20have%3A,Rangers%3A%201%20leader%20with%20a%20recommended%20second%20adult){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}
