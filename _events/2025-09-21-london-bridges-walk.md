Join the county walking team in the capital on Sunday 21 September when they will walk to, and over, 10 of the iconic bridges crossing the River Thames, taking in the famous sights of London and completing some fun photo challenges along the way.

The route is approximately 10km and is suitable for older Brownies and Guides with their leaders, and for Rangers, young leaders and adult groups.

Fundraising? Why not walk this 10k over 10 bridges and raise vital funds for your unit/international trips or a charity of your choice. The walking team can 'endorse' your paperwork for your supporters.

There is no cost to join this event but we do need you to register your team.

Girlguiding ratios apply (1:12 Guides and 1:8 Brownies).

Units are responsible for making their own way to the start/finish points which will be in the Vauxhall/Tower Bridge area respectively. Full route information will be supplied by the organisers.

Further details, joining information, risk assessments will be issued much nearer the event time.

Please register your entry no later than the end of July to the walking team on <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>
