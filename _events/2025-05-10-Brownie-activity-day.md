We are excited to announce details of our county Brownie outdoor activity day, taking place at the Cuffley Activity Learning Centre on Saturday 10 May.

This jam packed fun day will consist of 3 instructor led activities, other games upon arrival and pre-departure and your very own special badge!

Groups will not complete the same activities, but will all complete 3 activites from an extensive list of outdoor activities, such as crate stacking, leap of faith, climbing wall, zip line, fire-lighting, construction, orienteering, tomahawks and archery

**Limited to 300 spaces** on a first-come-first-served basis.

A deposit of Â£15pp will be required to secure the places, and you will be contacted by e-mail to make this payment.

Leaders will need to attend with their Brownies to maintain a ratio of 1:8.

Bookings now closed.
