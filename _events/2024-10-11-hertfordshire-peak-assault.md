Bookings are now open for this yearâ€™s Peak Assault (Hertfordshire Scouts camping, hiking, orienteering competition), taking from Friday 11 - Sunday 13 October.

Normally this event takes place in the mountains, but for this year only it is in Hertfordshire! This change has been made to enable more people to participate because costs are lower. So why not take the opportunity to have a go?

This super fun weekend is open to all Rangers and young leaders.

Leaders with teams or individuals wanting to take part should let the walking team know as there may be some funding available. They can also assist with putting individuals together to form a team, and provide support during the event.

Some tents, stove, rucksacks etc are available to borrow.

Contact the walking team on <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>
