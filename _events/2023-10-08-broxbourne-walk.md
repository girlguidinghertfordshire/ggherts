All members aged 14+ are invited to this guided social walk through beautiful deciduous woodland from 1.30pm - 3.00pm on Sunday 8 October.

A great opportunity to learn and practise your navigation skills too, if you wish.

Why not combine this with the [Sensory Safari](/event/sensory-safari/) taking place on the morning of the same day.
