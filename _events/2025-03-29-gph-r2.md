Now that round 1 of the county’s annual Great Patrol Hunt, for Guides aged 10 -15 years old, has been completed watch this space for round 2 bookings opening soon!

You do not need to have participated in round 1 to attend round 2 and if you are unable to make a full "patrol" then join the ‘GPH mavericks’, a patrol made of Guides from different units.

Each round of the competition has different and diverse challenges that encourage patrols to work together as a team. Marks are awarded for team work, presentation, effort, etiquette, good deeds and achievement throughout the challenges and the event.
