Join the county walking team for an unforgettable level 2 social walking weekend from **Friday 5 - Sunday 7 June,** set against the stunning, rugged backdrop of the Brecon Beacons (Bannau Brycheiniog) in Wales.

This event is for adults (18+) who are looking to clock some quality miles while enjoying the company of like-minded volunteers. Whether you are working toward your walking qualification or simply want to explore some of the most iconic peaks in the UK, this weekend offers the perfect blend of challenge and relaxation.

Expect breathtaking ridges, rolling green valleys, and plenty of "guiding chat" as we navigate the Welsh wilderness together. After a day on the hills, we’ll head back for a cozy evening of socialising, sharing stories, and resting up for the next adventure.

A fantastic opportunity to build your confidence in the uplands, sharpen your navigation skills, and strengthen your guiding friendships in one of Britain’s most beautiful National Parks.

Cost: £120 per person (includes accommodation and food). £50 deposit required (bank details will be provided on booking). Those attending will need to make their own travel arrangements.

To book your place, please email <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> by **Thursday 30 April.**
