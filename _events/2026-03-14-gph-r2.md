Round 2 of the county’s annual Great Patrol Hunt, for Guides aged 10 -15 years old, will take place on Saturday 14 March between 9.15am - 4pm at Townsend Church of England School in St Albans.

You do not need to have participated in round 1 to attend round 2 and if you are unable to make a full “patrol” then join the ‘GPH mavericks’, a patrol made of Guides from different units.

Each round of the competition has different and diverse challenges that encourage patrols to work together as a team.

Marks are awarded for team work, presentation, effort, etiquette, good deeds and achievement throughout the challenges and the event.

This event costs £10 per person.

Bookings for this event are now closed. Enquires to <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>
