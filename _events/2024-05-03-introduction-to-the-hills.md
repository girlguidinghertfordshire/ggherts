**Save the date.**

Introduction to the Hills is an established joint Girlguiding and Scouting event which has been running for over 40 years.

Following another successful year of ITTH, a jam packed weekend in the Peak District of camping, caving, climbing, cycling and hiking for Guides and Scouts aged 11 -13 years of age, next year's event dates have been released.

More details to follow.
