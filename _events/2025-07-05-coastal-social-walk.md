Join the county walking team, take in the East Sussex sea air, and enjoy a weekend of coastal walking from **Saturday 5 - Sunday 6 July**. The focus will be on walks that you can do with your girls and that are accessible by train from London.

You will have a choice of either the Seven Sisters coastal walk, or the Birling Gap to Eastbourne walk. Both roughly 12km. Public transport will be used to return from both walks.

Accommodation will be in a bunkhouse and cost Â£52 for both nights.

Food is available at the hostel, or you can bring your own, however, you must bring your own packed lunches for both days. 

Spaces are limited.

You will need to make your own way there.
