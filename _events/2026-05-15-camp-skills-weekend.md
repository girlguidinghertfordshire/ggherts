Following the success of the county's first camp skills weekend, applications are now open for our next one.

Open to Guides, Rangers and young leaders who want to get more camping experience and have a weekend of fun.

Taking place from 6pm on Friday 15* - Sunday 17 May 2026 at Hertfordshire Guide Centre in Cottered.

Young members will experience cooking over wood fires, whittling, wide games, pitching Icelandic tents, gadget making and more, whilst working towards their Stage 4 Camp skills builders.

This unforgettable weekend will be full of teamwork, laughter and learning lifelong skills.

1 leader must attend with Guides but Rangers/young leaders can attend without a leader.

This is a great opportunity for leaders who don't have their own going away with licence to offer their girls something new.

£30 per young member (payment will be requested by way of invoice after booking). Leaders go free.

Places are limited.

*Girls and their leader(s) can attend from 10am on Saturday morning if they are unable to arrive on the Friday night. The cost will remain the same.

Deadline for applications is Friday 17 April. Consent and health forms, which will be sent out with invoices after sign up, must also be completed and returned by this date.

Any questions please email <outdoor@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>
