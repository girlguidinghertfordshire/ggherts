Calling all Rangers, Young Leaders, Inspire members and other adult members.

Do you like the sound of a navigation challenge event in remote terrain? This is seriously fun and challenging in equal measure… and we have the visitors’ 14-18 trophy to defend and an adult one.

Come on girls!

This event is organised by Hertfordshire Scouts. For more information and to register click the buttom below  

Support crew can be provided at the event and much advice & help given. Email <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> to discuss further.

Bookings now open.

We would love Ranger (and adult) teams to enter the competition, but they MUST have had some prior remote terrain experience eg having attended Mountain Experience or done Gold DofE in an upland area. Please get in touch to discuss your girls’ abilities before registering officially.
