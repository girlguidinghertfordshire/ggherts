Join the walking team in the woods for an adventure with scavenger hunt, walking trail and mini den building.

Open to families as well as small groups of Rainbows and Brownies with their leaders.

**£5 refundable deposit** required from each group to cover the borrowing of equipment.

If you do not wish to attend as a unit please let your girls’ families know about this event and spread the word by passing the information on before the holidays.
