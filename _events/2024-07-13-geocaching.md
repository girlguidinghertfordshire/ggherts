If you are a leader who would like to learn about geocaching so you can run this activity with your girls, or help your Guides gain their geocaching badge, join the walking team at **10am** on **Saturday 13 July** for a circular walk (approximately 6km) near **Sacombe**.

You will discover 20 geocaches, and learn about geocaching, what it is and how to use the app or a gps unit.

Download the free app from [Geocaching.com](https://www.geocaching.com/play){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} beforehand.

If the weather is nice we will have a picnic lunch too.

To book please email <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>
