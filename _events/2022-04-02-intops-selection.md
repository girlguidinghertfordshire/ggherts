For leaders, Guides, Rangers and Young Leaders (who will be aged between 12 and 18 by 26 July 2023), who would like to be considered for an international trip or join a Girlguiding Hertfordshire group going to an event in the UK in 2023 our INTOPS selection days will be taking place on **Saturday 2 and Sunday 3 April 2022 from 9.30am - 5.30pm both days. _YOU ONLY NEED TO ATTEND ONE OF THE DAYS._**

## Leaders
Leaders should complete the Leaders Application Form and return it to the email address listed on the form.  Applications must be returned by **Friday 18 March 2022.**

## Guides, Rangers and Young Leaders
Guides, Rangers and Young Leaders should complete this online [INTOPS APPLICATION 2022 <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>][1]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noreferrer noopener"}.  You will also need to get your leader or commissioner to complete a reference form for you, which you can download below.  Your application will not be considered until the reference has been received.  Both applications and references must be returned by **Tuesday 1 March 2022.**

[Reference Form <i class="fa fa-download"></i>][3]{:class="btn-gg"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

**Any Guides aged 12 or 13 at the time of the trips will be offered a UK trip only.**

Should your application be accepted, you will be contacted via email with further details and an invitation to attend one of the INTOPS selection days (you can state your preference on the application form, but this is not guaranteed).  

Cost: **Â£15 per person.**

**PLEASE NOTE: If you have already been on an INTOPS weekend in Hertfordshire, you do not need to attend again as we already have your details and will be in touch with you once we have details of the 2023 trips.**

Please contact the county International Adviser, Lorraine England, via <international@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> should you have any queries.

Leaders please make this information available to your Guides, Rangers and Young Leaders.
