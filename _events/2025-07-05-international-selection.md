Taking place 1- 5pm on Saturday 5 July* at The Hertfordshire Guide Centre, Cottered.

Are you ready for an international adventure?

Would you like to travel and explore the world with other members of Girlguiding?

Girlguiding Hertfordshire have exciting opportunities planned for young people (aged 12 - 18 years old in the summer of 2026 and 2027) and adult leaders** to take part in international trips in 2026 and 2027.

Join us on this selection event to be considered.

Internationals are a great opportunity to make new guiding friends and explore more of the amazing adventures that Girlguiding has to offer across the world.
