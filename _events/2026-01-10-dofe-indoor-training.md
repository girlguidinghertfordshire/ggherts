This training weekend, taking place from Saturday 10 - Sunday 11 January at Cherry Green Trees in Colney Heath, is for those intending to undertake their Bronze / Silver practice (or/and qualifying) expeditions later in 2026.

All the main areas of the Bronze expedition training will be covered, and in relation to Silver DofE you will learn to use eDofE and OS maps, plan your practice expedition, revise higher level navigation skills, first aid, food and expedition aims.

It will be a great opportunity for participants to meet the other members of their future expedition teams.

Cost: £50 (includes indoor accommodation, food and resources).

For more information or to book a place please email <dofe@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>

Once you have completed your training you can progress to the [Bronze DofE practice expedition](/event/bronze-dofe-practice/) or [Silver DofE practice expedition](/event/silver-dofe-practice/).

More information about DofE within Girlguiding and qualifying age criteria can also be found on our [DofE page](/youth-opportunities/dofe/).

**If you are unable to meet these dates, please advise the [county DofE Award lead volunteer](mailto:dofe@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk) as soon as possible so that other counties can be contacted to see what opportunities they have available.**
