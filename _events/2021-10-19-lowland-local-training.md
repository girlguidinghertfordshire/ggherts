Anglia Region event with Hertfordshire trainers (Verity Maclachlan and Alison Tuch) **for those aged 16+** from Saturday, 4 - Sunday, 5 December 2021 at Ellesborough Guide Centre in Buckinghamshire. 

Do you lack the confidence to take your girls for a local walk, maybe in woodland or along the canal or river?  Would you benefit from a bit of help with map reading, planning a route and doing a risk assessment?  If so, this level 1 walking scheme training is for you. 

Cost: Thanks to funding from National HQ the cost will be **Â£20** (which includes all training, food and accommodation in bunk rooms!).

To register your interest/book please email [walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk](mailto:walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk)
