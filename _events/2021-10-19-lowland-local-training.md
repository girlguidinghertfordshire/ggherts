Anglia Region event with Hertfordshire trainers (Verity Maclachlan and Alison Tuch) from Friday, 19 - Sunday, 21 November 2021 at Ellesborough Guide Centre in Buckinghamshire. 

Do you lack the confidence to take your girls for a local walk, maybe in woodland or along the canal or river?  Would you benefit from a bit of help with map reading, planning a route and doing a risk assessment?  If so, this level 1 walking scheme training is for you. 

Cost: Â£20 (includes all training, food & accommodation in bunk rooms). This is being part funded by ###. 

Please register your interest with walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk but booking, once open, will be via the [Anglia Girlguiding website.](https://www.girlguiding-anglia.org.uk/events)
