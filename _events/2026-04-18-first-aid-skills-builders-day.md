Taking place at Radlett Guide HQ, Scrubbitts Park Road, Radlett, WD7 8JP on **Saturday 18 April** from 10am - 4pm, this is a fantastic opportunity to complete all the first aid skills builders for Guides and Rangers in 1 day and receive the I'm a lifesaver badge.

For this day to run, adult/young leader help (max of 8) is needed on the day. Ideally this will be leaders/young leaders attending with their Guides/Rangers who will work with the girls to complete the skills builders.

As the content of the day covers the majority of the 1st response syllabus, Rangers, leaders and young leaders, will have the option to attend a short Zoom session at a later date (date and time tbc) and gain their Girlguiding 1st response qualification.

Cost: £5 each (bank details set out in information and consent form). No cost for leaders/young leaders attending with their Guides/Rangers. There is a maximum of 40 girl spaces.

Uniform to be worn and please bring waterproof outdoor wear as some of the day will take place outside.

Refreshments will be provided but you should bring your own lunch and a water bottle.

To book email <verity.guides@gmail.com>.

**This event is almost fully booked, last few spaces remaining.**

Information and consent forms for each girl must be completed and returned by email by **26 March 2026.**
