Come along on the morning of Sunday 6 October and join the walking team for their circular autumn social walk for adults, starting and ending in Radlett.

This 11k walk, which will take approximately 3 1/2 hours, will take you via Aldenham and the Munden House Estate, then continues along the River Ver.

It is likely to be muddy so walking boots recommended.

There is the potential for home made tea and cake at the end of the walk!

Please email <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> for more information or if you would like to attend.
