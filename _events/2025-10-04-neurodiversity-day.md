Save the date.

Following the success and popularity of the neurodiversity session at this year's county network and development day we are running a full day (9.30am - 3pm tbc) on Saturday 4 October at the Christchurch Baptist Church, Welwyn Garden City dedicated to this important topic.

More details and how to book to follow soon.
