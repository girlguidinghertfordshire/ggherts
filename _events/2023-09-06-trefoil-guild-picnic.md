Trefoil Guild Hertfordshire would like to invite you to their picnic on Wednesday 6 September at Tolmers Scout Camp, Cuffley to celebrate the Trefoil Guild’s 80th anniversary.

There will be some of the on-site activities to have a go at, or you can wander around the site, or just sit in the pleasant surroundings for a chat and a cup of tea or coffee.  The evening will finish with a campfire.

Please bring a picnic tea with you and a chair. Drinks will be provided and maybe some cake.

There will be a solid shelter available with a small kitchen and toilets nearby.

Arrival is from **4pm** with the event finishing between 8.30pm – 9.00pm.

**Cost:** £5 per person which covers the cost of activities we are hoping to provide (ie quiz, garden games, orienteering, and a photo hunt).

Book your place by **Wednesday 16 August.**

Please wear suitable clothing and shoes for the weather.
