Are you ready for an international adventure? Would you like to travel and explore the world with other members of Girlguiding?

Girlguiding Hertfordshire have exciting opportunities for young people (aged 12 - 18 years old) and adult leaders* to take part in international trips in 2026 and 2027.

A selection event will be held on Saturday 17 May 2025 from 10am - 3pm in Hatfield.
