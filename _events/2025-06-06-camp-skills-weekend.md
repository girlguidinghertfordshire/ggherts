Taking place at Morven Guide Headquarters in Potters Bar, from 6pm Friday 6 June* - 3pm Sunday 8 June, this weekend is set to be full of fun and adventure, whilst gaining lots of skills.

Open to any girl who is wanting to get more camping experience.

Also, a great option for those leaders who do not have their own going away with licence, to offer something new to their girls.

This weekend will involve working on the camp skills builders, as well as other activities.

£30 per young member (payment will be requested by way of invoice after booking).

One leader must attend with Guides but Rangers/young leaders can attend without a leader. There is no charge for leaders.

Places are limited to 80, so don’t delay.

*Girls and their leader(s) can attend from 10am on Saturday morning, if they are unable to arrive on the Friday night. Cost will remain the same.

Apply on behalf of your unit before Friday 25 April (deadline extended from 4 April).
