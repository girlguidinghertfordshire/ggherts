The walking team are pleased to announce that the Mountain Experience (MX24) will be returning in 2024, taking place from Friday 15 to Sunday 17 March.

This weekend is aimed primarily at Rangers and young leaders but adults and leaders are also welcome.

A weekend full of social fun, delicious food and warm indoor accommodation.

Saturday evening is leisure time to get to know new friends, watch a film or play games.

The remainder of this walking weekend aims to teach participants how to navigate in the hills and on remote terrain by using maps and compasses.

Are you ready for an adventure?

This event is in conjunction with the Scout Explorers.
