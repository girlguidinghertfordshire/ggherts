Come along to 1 or more of our 3 working parties to help get our county centre in Cottered clean and ready for reopening, following completion of phase 1 building works.

This is the perfect opportunity to see for yourself the changes and improvements made so far and be part of this refurbishment project.

The day will run from **10am - 9pm** but you can join us at any time. Tea/coffee and treats provided, please bring your own lunch if you'll be with us for the lunchtime period.

For more information about the refurbishment project, including the reopening booking offer, please visit the [County Centre webpage.](/about-us/county-centre/)
