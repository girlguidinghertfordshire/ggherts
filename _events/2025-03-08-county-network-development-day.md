Save the date!

Taking place on Saturday 8 March 2025 at Howe Dell School in Hatfield, why not come along to our county network and development day.

This will be a wonderful opportunity to meet like-minded people and to exchange ideas whilst building upon your Girlguiding knowledge and skills.

A day of fun, reuniting with others from across the county, and making new connections with volunteers of all ages and levels.

Please let our [county training administration lead volunteer](mailto:guidingdev@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk) know what you would like to see included in this day and any personal development you require.

Further details to follow.
