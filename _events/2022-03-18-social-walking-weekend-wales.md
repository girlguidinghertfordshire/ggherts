Adult members of Girlguiding & friends are welcome to join the Walking Team on a social walking weekend in South Wales (Black Mountains or Brecon Beacons - exact location tbc) from the evening of Friday, 18th March until the evening of Sunday, 20th March. 
Walks will be led by qualified leaders so you can just walk & enjoy the scenery or practice your map reading skills if you wish to. 

Participants will be responsible for their own travel, but we will help set up car shares. 

Cost: TBC. We are currently investigating low-cost bunkhouse style accommodation. Cost will also include food and will be via bank transfer once known.

email: <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> to register your interest.
