We are delighted to announce that the county's Great Patrol Hunt, for Guides aged 10 -15 years old, will be back again soon.

The competition spans over a year and comprises of 3 rounds. Each round has different and diverse challenges that encourage patrols to work together as a team. Marks are awarded for team work, presentation, effort, etiquette, good deeds and achievement throughout the challenges and the event.

This 3rd, and final, round is a camping event full of excitement and fun as the overall winners will be found!

Further details to follow soon.
