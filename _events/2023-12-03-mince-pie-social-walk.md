Open to all ages and sections. Girlguiding members as well as their friends and families.

Come along as a family (and bring your siblings), or as a unit if you wish. The more the merrier!

Starting at Hertfordshire Guide Centre (HGC) in Cottered at 11.30am on Sunday 3 December join us for either a short figure of 8 walk following pavements, footpaths and grass verges spotting local landmarks on the [Cottered Photo Trail](/about-us/county-centre/local-area/#cottered-village-photo-trail).  Alternatively, there will also be a county walk option across fields and woodland.

These relaxing Sunday walks are for all ages to enjoy, with or without leaders, and will be topped off with seasonal refreshments.

Expected finish time of 2.30pm.

To book, email <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>
