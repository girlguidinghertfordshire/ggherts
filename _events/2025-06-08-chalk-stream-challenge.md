Bring your Rainbows, Brownies or Guides to complete their Chalk Stream challenge badge along the lovely River Chess with the walking team on **Sunday 8 June.**

An easy walking 4k circular walking route on good paths through meadow, woodland, and along the chalk stream.

Girls will complete multiple activities at points along the way which will include river dipping with a local expert from the Chiltern Chalk Stream Project.

The day will start and finish (registration) at [Chesham Moor Car Park, Moor Rd, Chesham HP5 1SE](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QopdewHb7SXEsmS8A){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}. GR SP963008. Although there is free parking car sharing is strongly requested.

Starting times will be staggered from 10am-1pm and the event will take around 2.5 hours to complete.

To register your interest and select your preferred 'earlier/later' starting time please email the walking team at <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> with the subject 'Chalk Stream' and include your unit name and section, preferred email address for information and an estimate of the number of girls you hope to bring.

At least one leader from each unit must attend with their girls, additional 'ratio adults' can be parent helpers.  The usual Girlguiding outdoor ratios apply 1:5 Rainbows, 1:8 Brownies and 1:12 Guides.  

Information and consent forms will be required for this activity and units will need to arrange their own home emergency contact.  

Nearer the time, a member from the walking team will contact you to confirm your booking and to take payment of **Â£5 per girl** which includes all activities and an event badge.
