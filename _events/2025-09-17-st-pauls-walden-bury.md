Come along on Wednesday 17 September at 3pm and explore the small, but beautiful, 18th century stately home and sculptured gardens of [St Paul's Walden Bury](https://www.stpaulswaldenbury.co.uk/){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} in Hitchin.

Enjoy a relaxing afternoon in what was the delightful childhood home of Lady Elizabeth Bowes Lyon; perhaps better known as the Queen's mother (HM Queen Elizabeth II).

Other activities are planned and each participant will get an Anglia Heraldry challenge badge (stage 2) to represent the Royal history connection to the house.

Tickets are Â£16* per person via [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/st-pauls-walden-bury-house-and-garden-a-beautiful-small-stately-home-tickets-1535674436579?aff=ebdsshother&utm_share_source=listing_android&sg=5b8adf3e72273e709758723506f63d9359962b26c225a054941725ca423dbff9ea7a3492d18c9272bef06ed727759e0ca1bfd1abae641eaf6c44446f8508b1c988b073824d35c7e84e347cbfa7fc){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}.
