Come along to St Albans Verulamium Park on **Sunday 8 March** (10am - 1pm) and join the walking team for an egg-citing Easter treasure hunt.

Starting at the Verulamium Museum car park, with staggered start times, the hunt, expected to take approximately 1.5 - 2 hours, is along an easy trail on good paths around the park and neighbouring streets.

With a spring in your step, keep your eyes peeled and find the clues!

Although aimed at Rainbows and Brownies, Guides and Rangers are welcome to attend and complete the trail under remote supervision.

Participants are welcome to attend in family groups or with units. If siblings wish to come an adult **must** accompany them.

Cost: £3 per young member (includes an edible prize).

Uniform to be worn plus comfortable trainers, warm top and waterproof coat.

Bring a small snack, filled water bottle and a pen in a daysack or small rucksack.

Bookings for this event are now closed. Enquires to <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>
