Bookings are now open for this year’s Peak Assault (Hertfordshire Scouts camping, hiking, orienteering competition), taking from **Friday 17 - Sunday 19 October.**

An exciting annual navigation competition, for teams of young people with the location traditionally kept a secret (In the past Peak Assault has visited many upland areas including: the Peak District, the Lake District, North Wales, Dartmoor, Exmoor and the Brecon Beacons).

The competition takes place over a weekend and teams must navigate to check points around the course to collect as many points as possible in a set time on Saturday and again on Sunday morning, camping overnight.

Peak Assault has been taking place almost every year since 1968. Run by and in conjunction with Scouts Hertfordshire it is aimed at Rangers, young leaders and adults with prior experience. Ideal for those that have already attended Mountain Experience or completed their Gold Duke of Edinburgh's award.

Please get in touch with the walking team on <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> to discuss your girls’ abilities before registering officially.
