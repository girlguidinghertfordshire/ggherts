This weekend is taking place from **6pm on Friday, 8 July until 8.30pm on Sunday, 10 July 2022.**

Accommodation is warm bunk rooms, all food and transport is included. Saturday evening free time to chill, chat, watch a film etc. Qualified Leaders will direct the walks & training, so participants can come without unit Leaders.
