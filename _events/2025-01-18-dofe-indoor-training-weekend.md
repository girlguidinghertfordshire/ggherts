This weekend, taking place from Saturday 18 - Sunday 19 January in Colney Heath, is for everyone intending to undertake practice of assessed expeditions later in 2025.

All the main areas of Bronze expedition training will be covered, and in relation to Silver DofE, you will learn to use eDofE and OS maps and plan your practice expedition, revise higher level navigation skills, first aid, food and expedition aims.

It will be a great opportunity for participants to meet the other members of their future expedition teams.

Cost: £50 (includes accommodation, food and resources).
