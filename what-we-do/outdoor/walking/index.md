We are an active, friendly and approachable walking team in Hertfordshire and we are available to help you run unit events or you can come on ours. We can arrange walks and activities for your unit as part of a meet, camp or holiday, so do get in touch for assistance (help will be provided with risk assessments).

Details of social walks and training opportunities can be found on the [Events](/events/) and [Training](/training/) pages. These include the annual Mountain Experience  (MX), a navigation training event aimed at Rangers (without leaders attending)  or The Duke of Edinburghâ€™s Award events.

Relaxing social walks and weekends away for leaders are also available, so you can mix with like minded adults, or train for the [Girlguiding walking scheme](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/information-for-volunteers/learning-and-development/leading-outdoor-adventures/walking-scheme/){:.external-link}{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and build up a log book.

Herts walking team are able to take you and your unit on a Geocaching adventure. Geocaching is a treasure hunt that uses coordinates to direct you to hidden containers called caches.

A fun activity to get your unit out and about exploring your local environment in many locations throughout Hertfordshire. Suitable for Brownies, Guides and Rangers alike.

The county walking team can offer to run this activity with you on any week day evening, except Tuesdays, or half days on weekends by arrangement.

Units need to provide appropriate adult/child supervision, a risk assessment (which the walking team can help with) and consent forms. The walking team will provide you with 1 or 2 leaders to support your group to locate and record local caches. The activity is best done in light hours (e.g summer term or until sunset in autumn term), or will require torches and additional adult supervision in the darker evenings.

Whether you wish to help your Guides undertake their Geocaching interest badge, or just want to have a fun event and learn a new skill with your unit, please contact <walking@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk> to arrange a session.
