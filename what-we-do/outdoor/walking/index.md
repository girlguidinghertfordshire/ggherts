We are an active, friendly & approachable walking team in Hertfordshire and we are available to help you run unit events or come on ours. We can run [geocaching sessions](/news/geocaching/) within units to teach the skills required for these fun treasure hunts, whether to aid the Guides Geocaching badge or just to learn a new skill for any age group. We can also arrange a walk on your unit holiday or camp, so do get in touch for assistance, including with risk assessments.

Rangers often attend walking events without their leaders, such as Mountain Experience, a navigation training event or [The Duke of Edinburgh's Award.](/youth-opportunities/dofe/)

We also organise social walks and weekends away for leaders, so you can a) relax without the girls and b) build up a log book if you wish to, with a view to doing some training and taking part in the Girlguiding Walking Scheme. So why not join us on one of our training or social weekends.  

Details of social walks and training opportunities can be found on the [Events](/events/) and [Training](/training/) pages.

You can also contact the walking team for some friendly advice via :
