Trefoil members are adults who enjoy life, make friends, support others, and value making time to do something ‘for them’ – and if it’s a challenge, so much the better! In this pressured world where wellness is vital, what could be better than growing and learning with like-minded individuals.

Every Trefoil is different. Some have all ages from 18 to 90; but whichever Trefoil you join, everyone decides on a programme together that provides the fun and friendship that gives Trefoil its central ethos.

If you were ever involved in Guiding, either as a Rainbow, Brownie, Guide, or Ranger, or just wish you had been then it is never too late to join in the fun! The Trefoil Guild is open to anyone who supports Girlguiding.
