            <p>Have you ever wanted to know what animals get up to at night? Now&rsquo;s your chance with Nature Nights, camping at the Zoo.</p>

            <p>Pitch your tent on the main lawn and spend the evening discovering what both native and exotic animals get up to at night. Girls can test their knowledge of animals before going on a torchlit expedition around the Zoo to see what they can find and who is still awake!</p>

            <p>Included in the nature nights experience is a torchlight expedition around the Zoo, unique access to the Zoo in the morning before it opens, free entry to Whipsnade Zoo (on the day of departure), a breakfast roll and drink and a flat pitch for the tents.</p>

            <p>Private bookings can be made for groups of 20-60 individuals.</p>
