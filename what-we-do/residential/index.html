<p>A residential is where members stay overnight at a location which could be camping or indoors.</p>

<p>To help you plan an exciting trip away our county residential team are researching external venues local to
    Hertfordshire.</p>

<p>The following Girlguiding approved venues are the first 2 to feature in our residential spotlight section.</p>

            <p>Whipsnade Zoo's indoor soft play space has been approved for Girlguiding residentials. Girls sleep inside
                their softplay area, learn about some of the animals that live at the zoo and have a tour of the zoo in
                the
                morning before it opens to the public.</p>

            <p>Debbie Carroll visited with the 2nd and 10th Harpenden Brownies. She said:</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote fst-italic fs-6">&ldquo;The Brownies really enjoyed sleeping in Hullabazoo. In
                the
                morning, we had
                fun watching the animals wake up before the zoo opened. Our favourite parts included watching the baby
                giraffe zoomies! We will definitely go again!&rdquo;</blockquote>

            <p>Marion Kett from 2nd Royston Brownies said:</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote fst-italic fs-6">&ldquo;The sessions were informal and great fun and included
                a
                night &amp; early morning walk. We slept in the Education Centre comprising large hall area, toilets and
                a
                classroom. Staff are all local and easy to contact should you need them. Our Brownies loved it and we'd
                certainly go again!&rdquo;</blockquote>
