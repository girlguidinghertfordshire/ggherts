Taking place on the extra Coronation Bank Holiday, Monday 8th May, between 10am - 3pm* as part of the [Big Help Out](https://thebighelpout.org.uk/){:external-link}{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}

Why not come along to the [Hertfordshire Guide Centre](/about-us/county-centre/) in Cottered (bring a friend - or two) and be part of this social working party.

See the new camp shelter for yourself and help paint the interior, as well as get the county camp store shipshape for the summer.

Take a peek at the exciting plans for the refurbishment of the centre whilst you are there.

Bring along your paint rollers, brushes, gloves (gardening and/or rubber) and wear old clothes - everything else will be provided including cake!

More hands make light work, so please do let us know if you can spare some time by emailing <anneacc@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>

Hope to see you there!

*You do not need to attend for the full duration.
