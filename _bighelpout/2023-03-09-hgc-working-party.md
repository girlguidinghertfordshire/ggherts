Taking place on the extra Coronation Bank Holiday, Monday 8th May, between 10am - 3pm* as part of the [Big Help Out](https://thebighelpout.org.uk/){:external-link}{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}

Why not come along to the [Hertfordshire Guide Centre](/about-us/county-centre/) in Cottered (bring a friend - or two) and be part of this working party.

See the new camp shelter for yourself and help get it ship shape for the summer, whilst taking a peek at the plans for the refurbishment of the centre.

**Tea and cake provided** so save the date. Further details to follow.

*You do not need to attend for the full duration
