Come and be part of Ware district's Big Help Out event on Monday 8 May.

Taking place between 9 - 11am in the grounds of Ware Priory, Ware, Herts.

Paint a bench, help litter pick, bring a food donation for the foodbank (tins, jars and packets a must), or all three.

The more the merrier - ALL welcome!

Come along and bring your friends, as we would love to see all ages involved on the day and speak to anyone who would like to find out more about getting involved in guiding within the district.
