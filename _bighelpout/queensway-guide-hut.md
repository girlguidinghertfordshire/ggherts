Help out at the Hemel Hempsted Queensway Guide Hut.

It will be open from 10am to 4pm.

They are looking for help with gardening, weeding and trimming. Please supply your own gloves and tools. We would also like some help to mow the lawn - we do have a mower.

They will also be a collection point for the local food bank.

They will provide tea, coffee and cake, plus a simple craft for children to do.
