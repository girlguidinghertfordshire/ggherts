<p>Girlguiding has now brought out an Adventures at Home badge to celebrate everything people have been doing to keep Guiding going during lockdown. This badge is for anyone who has taken part in Girlguiding activities from home during this time whether that’s been through virtual guiding sessions, Adventures at home activities or attending the Adventures at Home Festival. The badge can be ordered from the <a href="https://www.girlguidingshop.co.uk/products/badges/non-programme-badges/adventures-at-home-woven-badge--7744/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Girlguiding online shop</a>, code 7744 for £1 each.</p>
<p>We know your girls will enjoy these colourful badges, so have decided there is no need for Hertfordshire County to produce a competing one!</p>
