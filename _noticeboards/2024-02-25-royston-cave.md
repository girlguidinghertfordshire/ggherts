Royston Cave offers 30 minute guided tours to youth groups for up to 15 people, Monday - Friday, 9am - 7pm (subject to availability) at a special rate of Â£60.

The tour covers subjects ranging from geology, history and religion and can work on rotation, splitting larger groups up so one group explores the cave whilst others follow the Town Trail or head to Royston Museum.

Bookings can be made via the Royston Cave website: <https://www.roystoncave.co.uk/privatetours>
