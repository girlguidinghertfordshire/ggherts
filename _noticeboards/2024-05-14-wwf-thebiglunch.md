This June, WWF are supporting our friends at the Eden Project as they invite everyone to share friendship, food and fun in their communities with The Big Lunch.

The Big Lunch is the UK’s annual get-together for neighbours and communities, with millions of people coming together for a few hours of friendship, food and fun. It connects people and encourages friendlier, safer communities where people start to share more – conversations, ideas, skills, resources and friendship.

We are asking communities to host their own Big Lunch and fundraise for WWF at the same time, this could be with a collection bucket at the lunch, fundraising games, challenges, the possibilities are endless!

WWF and The Big Lunch working together to dish up ideas, top tips and resources to help make this year’s Big Lunch the greenest yet find everything you need to get your party started at <https://www.wwf.org.uk/thebiglunch>

Join millions and get involved with the national celebration of neighbours and community by hosting your own Big Lunch on 1-2 June!
