CAD offer low-cost minibus hire and transport to Schools, community groups, sports groups and not for profit organisations in and around Dacorum.

With a total of 9 minibuses in our fleet ranging from 13 - 17 seats with wheelchair access.

Our minibuses are ULEZ and congestion charge exempt.

We have volunteer drivers, paid drivers, and you can hire the minibus to drive yourself subject to terms & conditions. If you want to use your own driver they will need a MIDAS qualification or equivalent, we can help with this for a cost of £95 and it is valid for 4 years. Cost of hire starts from as little as £65 per day.
