<p>The CWGC honour and care for the 1.7 million men and women of the Commonwealth forces who died in the First and Second World Wars, ensuring that they will never be forgotten. Alongside our work at 23,000 locations around the world, our Public Engagement Network offer talks and tours to local groups to share the work of commemoration which continues to this day.</p>
<p>Sessions are personalised and can be adapted to a variety of ages, and include a number of topics such as 'Who We Are' and 'Gardening the World.' Many of these fit in with themes such as unity, respect, and climate change, and can be used as a platform to launch independent projects and research. They can also be paired with visits to local sites where Commission work can be seen and appreciated in person.</p>
<p>Sessions are offered for free and can last between 15-45 minutes.</p>
