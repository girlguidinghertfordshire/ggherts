Join the virtual [Festival of The Girl](https://www.festivalofthegirl.com), created for girls aged 7-11, on Sunday 10th October 2021 in celebration of International Day of The Girl.

The theme is My Brilliant Body, changing girls' perceptions of their bodies. Celebrating them for what they do for us, rather than how they are seen by others, and redefining what girl power means in 2021. We’ll be covering topics including sports and body image, physical careers from construction to being a surgeon and activities like beatboxing and coding.

The Festival is free and you can [sign up here](https://www.festivalofthegirl.com).  A downloadable PDF pack will be available on the website. 

Why not take a look at last year’s Festival to see how much fun the girls will have: Festival of The Girl 2020.
