The National Citizen Service (NCS) is a Youth Programme open to 15 to 17 year-olds in England over Summer and Autumn. It helps build their skills for work and life, while taking on new challenges and meeting new friends. 

NCS brings together young people from different backgrounds and helps them develop greater confidence, self-awareness and responsibility. It encourages personal and social development by working on skills like leadership, teamwork and communication. 

We are currently looking for seasonal staff members (18+) to work on both or either the NCS Programme or NCS Skill Boosters.  Please download the NCS Programme Leaflet and NCS Skills Booster Leaflet for more information.
