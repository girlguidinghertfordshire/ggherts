<p>In August 2018, three Leaders and twelve young women from Girlguiding Hertfordshire will travel to Uganda where they will complete a two week service project in an orphanage and local village community.  This includes teaching primary students, painting the school and building a toilet block.  It won’t all be hard work, as there will be fantastic opportunities for the group to attend cultural events and experiences, culminating in a three day safari.</p>
<p>Use the Challenge to plan a great District/Division Thinking Day or friendship event.  Alternatively, use the Challenge during your unit meeting or perhaps plan a sleepover, camp or holiday.</p>
