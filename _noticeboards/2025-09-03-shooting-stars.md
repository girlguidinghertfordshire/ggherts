> "Nick delivered an amazing session for 20 brownies whilst we were on pack holiday. His explanations were easy to follow. All the girls could participate, and the variety of activities was wonderful. They were all engaged for the full two hours. One little girl told us she had always wanted to do circus skills, and it was the best day of her life! Thanks so much."
