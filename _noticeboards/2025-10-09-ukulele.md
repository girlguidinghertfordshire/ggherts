Fun, hands-on "have a go" ukulele sessions specifically designed for young people are available to our members in the Bishop's Stortford area.

A confidence-boosting experience that gets everyone involved â€“ even the leaders!

You will learn a few simple chords, play along to one or two recognisable songs and have fun trying out the ukulele; gaining a sense of achievement and teamwork through music.

Instruments are provided and sessions can be tailored to suit any age group and adjusted to fit meeting times and badge goals, if desired.

If this sounds like something you and your girls would enjoy, please contact <lloydukulele@hotmail.com> to discuss dates and cost (fee is negotiable dependent on budget).
