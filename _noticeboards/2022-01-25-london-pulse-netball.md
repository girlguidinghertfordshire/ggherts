Bring your unit to watch a London Pulse Superleague netball match at the Copperbox Arena on the Olympic Park East London.

We provide a great sporting spectacle for young girls to see female elite athletes compete at the highest professional level. 

We are also the most diverse club in the Superleague with over 30 languages spoken. Our elite team is made up of a diverse player cohort which hopefully means that our role models will be familiar to the children watching and therefore truly inspiring.

Standard ticket prices for fans are:
Adults £20
Children (U18) £13

For larger groups (minimum of 10) we will offer a ‘Group Saver Discount Tickets’, for example:

- 12 tickets for the price of 10 (2 accompanying adults go free)
- 25 tickets for the price of 20 (5 accompanying adults go free).

Contact [Ticketline Customer Services][2] with adult and child numbers.

Season tickets and Members tickets go on sale on 10th October, with General sales starting on the 17th October
