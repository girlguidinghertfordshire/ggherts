Join Groundwork East to learn more about your local river and its heritage.

As part of the River Colne programmes, Groundwork East and Watford Borough Council are offering free sessions for schools and organisations.

## Junior River Champions (available up to March 2026)

We have an exciting opportunity to be a part of the Rediscovering the River Colne Programme in Watford.

Over a 1 - 1 ½ hour session learn more about your local river wildlife and environment and investigate a river sample to help monitor the health of the Colne by finding water invertebrates and other species.

Example session schedule:

- 15 mins: welcome and introduction
- 15 mins: River Top Trumps activity
- 45 mins: River sample investigation activity
- 15 mins: Summary of session
