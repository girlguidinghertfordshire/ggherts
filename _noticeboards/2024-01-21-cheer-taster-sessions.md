The 2028 Olympics will see Cheerleading included for the first time as an Olympic sport.  To invest in this sporting first, and encourage more girls to participate in team sports, Buzz Cheer are part of an initiative to broaden access for more girls from all economic backgrounds, in line with Sport England's national campaign: <https://www.sportengland.org/news/girl-can-you-launches>

Buzz Cheer are a local cheerleading team who have won all our division national championships, including at the Olympic Park in 2022 and 2023.

We'd love to offer free cheer taster sessions to Girlguiding Hertfordshire units. If you have any free slots this term and would like one of our fully insured and DBS checked coaches to run a session for any of your groups please contact <buzzcheerleading@gmail.com> or call [07932 640 777](tel:07932640777).
