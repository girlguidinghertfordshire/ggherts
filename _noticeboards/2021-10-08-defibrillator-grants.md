The tragic effects of the Covid 19 Pandemic have highlighted the fact that Cardiac Arrest does not discriminate and affects anyone, at any time, of any age!

Cardiac Arrest kills over 60,000 people, of all ages, in the UK each year.  If a heart defibrillator is used within 3-5 minutes of a cardiac arrest, the chances of survival increases from 6% to a huge 74%.

We currently have a Â£300 grant available towards the cost in order to assist you in acquiring a defibrillator.  With every Defibrillator we supply, we provide free online CPR/defibrillator awareness training.

Equipment is available now.

In order to proceed in obtaining a Defibrillator simply complete the short online application to receive a quote: [londonhearts.org/apply-for-a-defib](https://londonhearts.org/apply-for-a-defib)

If you have any queries please contact <tia@londonhearts.org> or telephone [020 7043 2493](tel:02070432493).
