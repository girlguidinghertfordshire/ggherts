Recent tragic cardiac arrest events involving persons at the peak of their fitness goes to show that cardiac arrest can happen to literally anyone, anytime, anywhere!
 
If you go into cardiac arrest, without a defibrillator, you have a 7% chance of survival.  If a defibrillator is on the patient within the first 3-5 minutes, the chances of survival is over 70%.

London Hearts have launched an initiative to assist in obtaining this life-saving equipment. We are currently able to offer an increased grant to Â£300 towards the cost of every Defibrillator we supply to Girlguiding across England.  

With every Defibrillator we supply we provide free online training.

Equipment is available now and can be with you in a matter of days.
