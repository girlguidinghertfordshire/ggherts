Recent publicised events have highlighted the fact that cardiac arrest does not discriminate and can happen to anyone, of any age, at any time!

Cardiac arrest kills over 60,000 people, of all ages, in the UK each year.  If a heart defibrillator is used within 3-5mins of a cardiac arrest, the chances of survival increases from 6% to a huge 74%.

We are currently able to offer you charity grant funding towards the cost of each defibrillator we supply.

With every defibrillator, we also provide free online CPR/defibrillator awareness training.

Equipment is available now.

If you have any queries please feel free to contact <jess@londonhearts.org> or call 020 7043 2493

To receive further information on the defibrillators we supply along with a non-obligatory quote, simply complete our short online application at: [londonhearts.org/apply-for-a-defib](https://londonhearts.org/apply-for-a-defib)

If you do have the benefit of a defibrillator please ensure you check that it is still under manufacturer warranty and that the pads & battery have not expired.
