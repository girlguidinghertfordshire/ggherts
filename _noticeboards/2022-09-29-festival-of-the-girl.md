This year's [Festival of The Girl](https://www.festivalofthegirl.com/){:.external-link}{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noreferrer noopener"} is on Sunday 9th October at the Business Design Centre Islington, North London and we've got discounted tickets for all Girlguiding groups who can join us!

At this year's festival we want to show girls what the future holds for them, get them trying something new, having fun and leaving with a boost of confidence. Activities and workshops range from: aerospace engineering to gaming, keyhole surgery to paralympic sports, choreography to activism, mental health to mechanics, football tricks to magic tricks and much more.

Tickets can be bought using the discount code FOTG225 and cost Â£3.50 per child.  Adults go free.
