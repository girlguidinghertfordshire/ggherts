The Royal Air Force (RAF) Museum in London are running a Black History Month event especially for Guides (ages 10 - 14) on **Saturday 18 October.**

Celebrating Black History Month, girls will explore stories of current and historical Black role models within the RAF, their contributions and the prejudice some of them faced.

They will look at how members of Girlguiding can act as allies to support a fair, just, and equitable society.

Running from **11am - 1pm,** the day will start with a presentation by a member of the Learning team facilitators, including interactive elements such as uniforms and items from the Handling Collection. Girls will then complete a museum trail and be presented with this year's Girlguiding Black History Month badge.

Cost: £5 per child (includes the cost of badge).
