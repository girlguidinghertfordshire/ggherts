Fox Cycling Hertford and Ware, based out of Watton at Stone, is one of only 6 franchises across the UK.

We help children learn to ride bicycles and teach younger children in fun balance bike classes and would love to get more children learning this life skill.

We can offer:

- Fun balance bike classes for children between 2.5-5 years old, teaching the core skills needed for pedalling.
- Learn to cycle classes, which are 1 on 1 classes where we teach children from 4.5 years upwards how to cycle in an hour.
- Improvers; which are confidence building classes for children that can already ride, but will benefit from learning vital skills.
- Pedal Plan; a bicycle subscription model, where parents rent child specific bikes from us on a monthly bases only to return them when their child has outgrown the bike and they need to swap for a bigger one.

For more information and prices take a look at our [website](https://foxcycling.co.uk/) and [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/foxcyclinghertfordandware/).
