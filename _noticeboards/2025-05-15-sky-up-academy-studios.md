[Sky Up Academy Studios, Elstree](https://www.skyup.sky/academy-studios/elstree){:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} is an exciting immersive learning experience for schools and youth organisations for children aged 10 - 18 years old.

This is a fantastic, once in a lifetime opportunity, to dive into creativity, digital skills, and hands-on learning in a unique environment.

Over the course of a half-day visit, young people will get an all-access backstage pass to Sky’s new state-of-the-art film and TV studio in Elstree in Hertfordshire, where they’ll be developing and creating their very own film ideas.

At Sky, we want young people to dream big and build the confidence and skills they'll need to make their ideas a reality. Skills like:

- **Idea development:** Students will enhance their creative thinking and brainstorming skills through a pre-visit masterclass designed to ignite their creativity and help them generate unique ideas.
- **Digital know-how:** They will gain hands-on experience with the latest extended reality (XR) technology, building digital literacy and technical skills that are highly relevant in today’s digital landscape.
- **Enhanced literacy and storytelling skills:** They will improve their literacy by understanding and applying on-screen storytelling structures and character archetypes, helping them craft compelling narratives.
- **Industry-specific career knowledge:** They will deepen their understanding of various career paths within the media and entertainment industry through a careers challenge that encourages exploration and critical thinking.
- **Communication and presentation skills:** They will build confidence and public speaking skills as they pitch their film ideas to an audience and panel of judges in a post-visit challenge, boosting their ability to communicate effectively and persuasively.

Session are available throughout the summer holidays, during July and August. But be quick – slots are filling up fast.
