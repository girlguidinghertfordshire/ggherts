Nominations for the 2022 CPRE Hertfordshire Awards are now open.

We would love to receive nominations for projects which:

- connect people with the countryside and their local green spaces
- promote rural life and ensure that communities can thrive
- improve or protect the environment

Nominees might be volunteer-based projects or events, community groups, individuals, or small businesses.

*We also hope to make an Award for an outstanding project or activity run by or on behalf of young people (up to the age of 21) in the categories above.*

We know there are lots of young people throughout Hertfordshire who do amazing things and deserve to be recognised.
