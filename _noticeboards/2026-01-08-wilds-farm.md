The Wilds Farm CIC is a non-profit community farm that's running a tree planting drive from January - April 2026 in Ledburn to create a nature corridor and support local biodiversity.

The founder, Chloe, a former Girlguiding member in Cheddington, would like to invite units to participate in a 2-hour tree planting session, where girls will learn to transplant and care for saplings, how these spaces support wildlife and the best times of year/conditions to do so.

This activity could contribute towards the Eco award and badges such as the Great outdoors, Animal helper or Biodiversity!

Sessions cost £5 per child. Wilds Farm CIC have secured a grant to enable free access for children with SEN, young carers or those from low-income households to ensure as many people as possible that want to take part can do so. Please get in touch with any grant access queries you may have.

Please complete the expression of interest form and Chloe will get in touch to confirm a date that works for you. Even if you're unsure of numbers, please register your unit's interest as a multi-unit day can be organised if needed.

Session length can be adapted to meet your unit's needs (please advise any changes required within the expression of interest form).
