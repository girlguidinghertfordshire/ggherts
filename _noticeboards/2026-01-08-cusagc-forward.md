Entries are now open for 'Forward 2026', Cambridge University Scouts and Guides Club (CUSAGC)’s annual day incident hike for members of Scouts and Guides aged 10 and over (that includes leaders!).

This year’s event is taking place on **Saturday 14 March 2026** starting in West Wickham near Cambridge.

The challenge is for teams of 4-6 to gain points by visiting as many checkpoints as possible in 7 hours, over a distance of roughly 10 miles.

Teams are given grid references for the checkpoints and must choose their own route, starting and finishing at West Wickham Village Hall. The majority of checkpoints are unmanned, but teams can gain more point at manned checkpoints where there are further challenges to complete.

Separate trophies for Girlguiding and Scouting teams are up for grabs!

Entry fee: £20 per team (includes hot drinks at the halfway base and hot snacks and drink at the end of the day, as well as covering the other running costs of the event).

Blanket badges can be purchased at an additional cost of £2 each, paid for at the same time as the team entry fee.

Entry forms and payment must be completed by **Saturday 14 February** and health forms returned by **Saturday 7 March.** Links to both forms are available in the Entry pack.

Entries are first come, first served and places are limited. Confirmation and final details will be sent out shortly after entries close.
