DH Dance Academy, a local dance school, are offering free dance workshops to Rainbows, Brownies and Guides, covering a wide range of dance styles, as part of our mission to give back to the local community and inspire more young people to get moving in a fun, supportive environment.

Our team of experienced teachers offer numerous options to develop and encourage students’ love of dance and performing arts and we’d absolutely love to work with Girlguiding groups across the Welywn and Hertford area.

Our workshops are:

✨ Fun and energetic  
🎶 Tailored to your age group  
🤝 Focused on teamwork and confidence  
🌟 No dance experience needed – just enthusiasm!
