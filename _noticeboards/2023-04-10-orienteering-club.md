Orienteering is a fun, low-cost adventure sport that requires people to find a series of checkpoints on a map in the quickest time. It’s a great sport that:

* Provides outdoor fun for all the family
* Exercises the mind and body
* Combines running with decision making
* Combines running (or walking, for that matter) with map reading skills

For young people in particular:

* It provides physical and intellectual development
* Helps develop spacial awareness
* Teaches them about the countryside
* Helps them read maps and navigate
* Is educational and fun at the same time

Hertfordshire Orienteering Club (also known as Happy Herts) event's are inclusive and open to all; beginners are very welcome.
