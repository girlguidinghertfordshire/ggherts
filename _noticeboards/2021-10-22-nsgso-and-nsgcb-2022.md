The residential course runs from **Saturday, 30 July 2022 - Sunday, 7 August 2022** in Stourbridge, West Midlands, with concerts held at prestigious venues in the Birmingham area, as well as the first ever completely joint concert between the NSGSO and NSGCB at Coventry Cathedral.

## The NSGSO and NSGCB Course

The NSGSO and NSGCB meets every year for a fantastic week's course of music and social activities, culminating in two concerts in the community for the Concert Band, and multiple concerts for both the Concert Band and the Symphony Orchestra on Friday 5th and Saturday 6th August at prestigious venues in the Birmingham area. 

This year we are particularly excited to introduce a completely joint concert between the Concert Band and Symphony Orchestra at Coventry Cathedral as Coventry will have been UK City of Culture 2021. To see for yourself what the course involves, watch our [short promotional film.](https://youtu.be/7E6kTJVungs)

_[As the NSGSO and NSGCB course was cancelled in 2021 due to Covid, those members have been given priority for the 2022 course. We have therefore already closed a handful of instruments, and these are stated on the Instruments page. No other instruments will close before the closing date in December.   Apologies for this, but all instruments will be open as usual for the 2023 course.]_

## The NSGSO and NSGCB Ensembles

The 2022 course will be the 47th year of the Symphony Orchestra, with the Concert Band having been reformed in its current format 6 years ago, running alongside the Orchestra course. The NSGSO and NSGCB have separate identities but are managed together, so whilst they have separate rehearsals and concerts, participants from both groups come together for accommodation and social activities, and this year they will be completely sharing the concert in Coventry Cathedral for the first time! 

Applicants therefore have the choice of the two ensembles to apply for, though there are slightly different criteria and instrument choices for each. Please [visit our website](https://nsgso-nsgcb.com/take-part/){:target="_blank"} for more detailed information.

For anyone wishing to use this course for their DofE, QSA or QGA residential then this year must be the first time that they have attended.

You will hear before 31st December 2021 if your application has been successful or not.


_**COVID-19:** We are acutely aware of the fact that COVID-19 still poses a risk to us being able to hold the 2022 course.  At the current time we are planning on being able to deliver the course as planned, but please feel assured that we will be monitoring the situation at every stage in our process, with our first priority being to keep all of our participants, tutors and staff members safe._  

_Please do still send your applications in during our application period, and feel free to contact us on [info@nsgso-nsgcb.com](mailto:info@nsgso-nsgcb.com) with any concerns.  We will be updating these questions as further information is given to us by The Scout Association, Girlguiding and the government._
