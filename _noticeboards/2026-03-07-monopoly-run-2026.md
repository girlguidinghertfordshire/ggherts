Monopoly Run is back!

Bookings are now open for the next game, taking place on **Saturday 7 March.**

Monopoly Run is the country's largest Monopoly themed event for Guides and Scouts, using the real street of London as the game board.

Over 8,000 members took part in the last "run" so why not get involved in this exciting event.

It is played in a single day, in central London, and involves visiting the actual sites that the board game is based on. A bespoke control system allows multiple ‘mini-games’ to occur simultaneously, enabling hundreds of teams to compete on the day, yet each team will only have a maximum of 7 other competitor teams, giving everyone a good chance at winning.

Players visit as many sites as possible and test their problem solving skills along the way.

Tactics and speed in navigating the capital will win the day!

This event sells out quickly so don't delay in getting your team together.
