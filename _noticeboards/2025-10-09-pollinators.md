Fun and informative workshops designed by Andie Hill, a Hertfordshire-based designer and artist who has kept bees for over 20 years, specifically for Girlguiding members.

The workshops include a short talk about the different types of pollinators, their habitats and the challenges they face, followed by an activity/game where you'll put into practice everything you've learnt and help the pollinators get their pollen and nectar safely back to their homes.
