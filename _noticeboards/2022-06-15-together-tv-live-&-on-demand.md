Together TV's new streaming service, which aims to inspire positive social change, has arrived!  You can enjoy hundreds of on-demand titles anywhere, anytime for **FREE**.

As the world’s first community-owned charitable television channel, Together TV’s streaming service reflects this purpose-driven ethos throughout the platform. It does this by connecting the programming to genre-specific resources and campaigns to **_“Channel Your Inner Good”_**. For example, those watching a gardening series will be encouraged to **_“Channel Your Inner Grower”_**. Here viewers will find more information about the Sunflower Challenge - a behavioural change campaign to improve well-being and reduce social isolation through gardening, fronted by TV gardener Danny Clarke.

Together TV’s catch-up service enables viewers to watch programmes they might have missed, including factual entertainment series and thought-provoking documentaries. In addition, there is original content created through Together TV's Diverse Film Fund including BAFTA-winner “Our Land”. The content catalogue will become richer and deeper with more fan favourites as the channel’s programming becomes available to catch up and stream.

It's available on mobile, tablet and desktop, via the Apple app store and Google Play store, and [watch.togethertv.com.](https://watch-togethertv.com){:.external-link}{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noreferrer noopener"}
