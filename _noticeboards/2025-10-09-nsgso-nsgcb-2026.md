Do you play an orchestral or concert band instrument to grade 4 or above and will be aged between 12 and 25 by August 2026?

Why not spend a week during the summer in Stourbridge, West Midlands, working alongside other talented musicians rehearsing, socialising and attending workshops. All leading up to taking part in concerts in the Birmingham area at the end of the week.

Applicants will find out mid December whether they have been successful or not.
