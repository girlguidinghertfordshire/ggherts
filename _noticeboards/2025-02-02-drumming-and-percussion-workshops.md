Drum workshops for Girlguiding groups and camps.

We bring all the instruments to your venue, and everyone has an instrument throughout the workshop. Instruments are swapped around so that everyone gets chance to play more than one.  

The main aim is always that participants should have fun, and thereâ€™s always a strong theme of working together.

For camps, **Drum Circle** workshops are offered, which can be tailored in length to suit your programme.

For group visits, there are several different workshops, including Drum Circle, to offer:

**Sammy the Spider** - Geared for Rainbow aged children - the story of Sammy, the Spider who has no friends is told through rhythm with a selection of soft toys. The children get to participate, interacting through the journey of discovery as Sammy makes some rather special friends.

**Drum Circle** - A Drum Circle is always a unique team working experience: the participants improvise their own rhythms; the facilitator works with this to draw out the best. Together, the group provides a level of musical sophistication which always surprises!

**African Celebration** - Children learn techniques and rhythms to accompany a traditional African song. They will also learn a little about the role of the Master Drummer and how rhythm fits into African culture.

Costs vary depending on the distance we will need to travel, but we work on an honesty basis to make our workshops affordable. We often work with more than one section or unit on the same evening so that the costs can be shared.

We have special day rates for bigger events and camps.
