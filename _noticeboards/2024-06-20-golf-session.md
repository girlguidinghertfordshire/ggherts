Hertfordshire Golf are offering visits to units to run golf sessions. They even provide the plastic golf training kit required.

Alternatively, you may prefer to take your girls out and about to a local golf club.

Contact Hertfordshire Golf via <cdo@hertfordshiregolf.org> who will be happy to help arrange a session and introduce your girls to a fantastic new sport.

Why not complete the county [girls golf challenge badge](/get-involved/challenge-badges/#girls-golf-challenge-badge) at the same time.
