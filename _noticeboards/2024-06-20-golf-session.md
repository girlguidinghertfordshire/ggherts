Hertfordshire Golf are offering visits to units to run golf sessions. They even provide the plastic golf training kit required.

These sessions cover the golf skills section of the [Girls Golf challenge badge](/get-involved/challenge-badges/#girls-golf-challenge-badge) so why not complete the challenge badge at the same time. Where possible, the other sections of the challenge badge should be completed before booking a visit and placing their badge order.

To arrange a session and introduce your girls to a fantastic new sport please email all 3 of the following Hertfordshire Golf team members, ensuring you include your unit's location:

- <talamsclarke@gmail.com>
- <mrsfreethy@yahoo.co.uk>
- <cdo@hertfordshiregolf.org>

Alternatively, you may prefer to take your girls to a local golf club and the Hertfordshire Golf team can help you arrange this.

**NB. If you have emailed <cdo@hertfordshiregolf.org> prior to 20 October, to request a session, but haven't yet heard back, please email again to ALL of the above addresses and Hertfordshire Golf's new team will allocate a golf coach based on their/your location.**
