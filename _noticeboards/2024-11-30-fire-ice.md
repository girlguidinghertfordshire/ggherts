Following the success of this year's event, Fire and Ice is back in 2025!

Taking place from Friday 17 - Sunday 19 January, this action packed weekend, gives Guides, Scouts and their adult leaders, the opportunity to experience the joys of winter camping, a wide range of activities (from adventurous to traditional Scouting skills), and a number competitions.

Activities run on the Saturday from 9am - 6pm with music and fireworks in the evening. 

On the Sunday you can either book additional activities or spend the day relaxing and doing your own thing.

Rangers can attend as young leaders but will not be able to take part in events.

Bookings close 2 weeks before the event (or sooner if fully booked before).
