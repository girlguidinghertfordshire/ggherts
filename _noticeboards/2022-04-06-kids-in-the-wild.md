Love Productions, the makers of *The Great British Bake Off* and *Junior Bake Off,* are making a brand new series for Channel 4, and are looking to find kids to take part in a once in-a-lifetime wild camping adventure this summer.

They are looking for kids ages 9-11 from all areas of the country, from a range of backgrounds, abilities, and ethnicities.

The adventure takes place over 2 weeks during the summer holiday in a secret camp site somewhere in Britain!

The programme will explore what kids are capable of in an outside wild environment.

**Please note: the kids will be constantly supervised by trained chaperones/experts.**

Visit [Kids in the Wild website][1]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noreferrer noopener"}{:.external-link} for details on how parents can register interest on behalf of their child

Deadline for applications: **8.59pm on Sunday 10 April**
