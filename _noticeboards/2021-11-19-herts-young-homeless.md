Our annual sleepout event will be held on Friday, 19 November at Oaklands College.  It is our BIGGEST fundraising event and this year we have an ambitious target to reach - Â£30,000 

We guarantee an evening filled with entertainment and other fun activities. The event will also raise awareness of the serious issue of young people and homelessness.  Last year, we supported 2,495+ vulnerable young people in Hertfordshire who were homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.  We provide vitally needed services and resources for vulnerable young people when they need it the most.

Why not register to take part in this unique experience and make a difference.  Doing good makes you feel good. [https://www.hyh.org.uk/sponsoredsleepout](https://www.hyh.org.uk/sponsoredsleepout){:target="_blank"} 

We look forward to seeing you on 19th November.
