Get ready for the best youth group adventure at KidZania London!

Let aspirations and inspiration soar as children step into the indoor city built just for kids aged 4-14. Here they can [work, earn and play][1]{:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} just like the real world, all in a safe and inclusive environment thanks to KidZania’s ever-expanding programme of careers role-play.

From learning what it takes to fly the skies with [British Airways][2]{:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} in a real-life flight-training simulator, to sniffing out a good story with [Metro newspaper][3]{:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}, many careers are run in partnership with real-life brands to enhance understanding of real jobs and the skills required.

There are also lots of opportunities for organised youth groups to work towards badges!

Tickets from £19.50 per child and £10.50 per adult, with a free leader place for 1 in every 10 children. [Find out more and book your tickets.][4]{:.external-link}{:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}
