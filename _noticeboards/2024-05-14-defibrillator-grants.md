London Hearts, the leading heart charity dealing with the funding, procurement and supply of life-saving defibrillators throughout the entire of the UK are offering grant funding towards the cost of each defibrillator it supplies.

Recent publicised events have highlighted the fact that **Cardiac Arrest does not discriminate and can happen to anyone, of any age, at any time.**

If a heart defibrillator is used within **3-5mins** of a **cardiac arrest,** the chance of survival **increases from 6% to a huge 74%.**

With every defibrillator, free online CPR/defibrillator awareness training is also provided.
