London Hearts, the leading heart charity dealing with the funding, procurement and supply of life-saving defibrillators throughout the entire of the UK

Recent publicised events have highlighted the fact that **Cardiac Arrest does not discriminate and can happen to anyone, of any age, at any time.**

If a heart defibrillator is used within **3-5mins** of a **cardiac arrest,** the chance of survival **increases from 6% to a huge 74%.**

The current funding schemes we have running (which enables us to provide the equipment at reduced costs) are ending soon. A limited amount of funding remains; we can supply the following depending on where you wish to locate a Defibrillator:

- Mindray C1A Fully Automatic Defibrillator & C Series Carry Case – **currently just £660 exc VAT under our scheme.**
- Mindray C1A Fully Automatic Defibrillator & Internal Wall Bracket - **currently just £660 exc VAT under our scheme.**
- Mindray C1A Fully Automatic Defibrillator & Internal Cabinet with door alarm - **currently just £660 exc VAT under our scheme.**
- Mindray C1A Fully Automatic Defibrillator & External heated Locked or Unlocked Cabinet – **currently just £950 exc VAT under our scheme.** (Please be advised the external cabinet requires a power supply & is not suitable for installation into a phone box).
- Bleed control kit - **£49.50 exc VAT.**

(VAT will only be applied if the payee is VAT registered.)

Our schemes are run on a first come first served basis and there is currently no limit to the number of units you require. Once our funding has been exhausted the schemes will close. As with all previous schemes we have run, demand is high, so we advise you act promptly.

The only eligibility requirements are:

- You are based within the UK.
- To share with any interested third party our free online recorded CPR/Defibrillator awareness training which we will provide via email at point of dispatch.
- Responsible for ongoing maintenance i.e.simple routine visual checks, replacing of battery and pads when required.
