Marathon is Cambridge University Scouts and Guides Club (CUSAGC)’s annual day/night incident hike, open to teams of 4-6 members of Scouts, Girlguiding (aged 14+ including Trefoil Guild), leaders and Student Scout and Guides Organisation (SSAGO) groups.

This year’s event is taking place on **Saturday 15 November** in West Wickham, starting and ending at West Wickham Village Hall (CB21 4SB).

The challenge is for teams to gain points by visiting as many of the 26 checkpoints as possible in 9 hours, over about a 70 sq. km area.

Teams are given grid references for the checkpoints and must plan their own route. The majority of checkpoints are unmanned, but teams can gain more points at manned checkpoints where there are further challenges to complete.

There are 3 trophies available to be won for the highest scoring teams: 1 for under 18 Scouting teams, 1 for under 18 Girlguiding teams and 1 for teams with members over 18 years of age. However, the number of checkpoints you visit is up to you, so it can just be a stroll in the countryside if you prefer!

The Marathon Challenge is suitable for all levels of ability. Due to the distance covered, time needed to complete challenges at manned checkpoints, and the fact that some navigation may be in the dark, only the very best teams will manage to visit all 26 checkpoints.

**Entry fee:** £14 per person (includes hot drinks at the manned bases and a hot meal at the end of the day, as well as a badge for your camp blanket). You will need to bring your own lunch.

Entry forms and payment (cheque) must be returned by **Saturday 25 October.** Entries are first come, first served and places are limited. Confirmation and final details will be sent out shortly after entries close.

Health and consent forms must be completed and returned for all team members by **Saturday 8 November.**
