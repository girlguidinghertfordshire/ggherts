Following the success of previous open days, South West Herts Narrowboat Trust are opening their gates once again on Saturday 5 March for anyone interested in having a go at narrowboating.    

Guiding leaders/organisers are welcome to come along to find out if spending time on a narrowboat would be of benefit to their unit or could form an interesting addition to their annual events programme. 

For more information on what the day will include and how to register your interest please download the Open Day flyer.
