Fancy trying something new with your members?

Whether you are looking for girls to make personal gifts, or just learn a new skill, the unique ancient art of Leatherwork can be enjoyed by all and take place in your own unit.

No experience is needed and all equipment and tools are provided.

Have fun creating something truly personal.

If you are interested in adding this to your programme please contact Jason on <mhadcevents@gmail.com> to discuss and arrange.

Jason also offers Whittling sessions, if you would prefer to craft with wood rather than leather - why not book both!
