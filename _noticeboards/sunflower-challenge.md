Following the success of Together TVs Sunflower Challenge last year, we are pleased to announce it's return for 2023!  

This hands-on, 12 week challenge to grow a radiant sunflower from seed is a national initiative to improve mental health and tackle social isolation, using gardening as a way to connect with local community groups

This year's challenge includes new elements, so join the waitlist now to be the first to hear when registration opens.
