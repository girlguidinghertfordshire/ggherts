Following the success of Together TVs Sunflower Challenge last year, we are pleased to announce it's return for 2023!  

This hands-on, 12 week challenge to grow a radiant sunflower from seed is a national initiative to improve mental health and tackle social isolation, using gardening as a way to connect with local community groups

Registration is now open for this yearâ€™s challenge, which includes new elements.
