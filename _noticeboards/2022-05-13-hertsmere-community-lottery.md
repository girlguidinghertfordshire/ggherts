Hertsmere Community Lottery is a free online fundraising tool, to raise vital funds for local good causes. Since its launch in December 2021, 25 good causes have registered with 200 supporters, and we are on track to raise around £13,000 for good causes in our local community this year.

Are you a unit within Hertsmere?  Would some on-going fundraising benefit your unit?  If so, then take a look at our website: [Hertsmere Community Lottery: Easy online fundraising for good causes - Hertsmere Community Lottery <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>][1]{:target="blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to find out how you can join the Hertsmere Community Lottery family.

There are no registration fees or set up costs and money raised from the tickets you sell, go directly back to you each month. 

By taking part in the lottery, supporters donate 50p of every £1 ticket directly to the organisation. Lottery draws take place every Saturday at 8pm and supporters are in with the chance of winning the £25,000 jackpot. Other cash prizes include £2000, £250, £25 and 3 extra tickets.
