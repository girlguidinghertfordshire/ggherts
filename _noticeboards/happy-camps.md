HAPpy is the Hertfordshire's Holiday Activities and Food Programme.

Hertfordshire County Council has joined forces with the Herts Sports Partnership and the Hertfordshire Community Foundation to organise a programme for the school holidays every Easter, Summer and Christmas until 2024.

School children in Reception to Year 11 who attend a Hertfordshire school and are in receipt of benefits related free school meals are eligible to receive a code and attend a HAPpy Camp across Hertfordshire during the school holidays.

Bookings via the [Herts Sports Partnership website](https://sportinherts.org.uk/happy/booking/).
