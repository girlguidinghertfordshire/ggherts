School aged children who attend a Hertfordshire school and and are in receipt of benefits related free school meals can enjoy free food, free sports, and free craft activities at HAPpy Camps across Hertfordshire during the Summer holidays (there will be no camp on bank holiday Monday 28 August).

HAPpy is the Hertfordshire activation of the national Holiday Activities and Food Programme. Hertfordshire County Council has joined forces with the Herts Sports Partnership and the Hertfordshire Community Foundation to organise a programme for the school holidays every Easter, Summer and Christmas until 2024.

Bookings for Summer HAPpy camps go live at 12 noon on Monday 26 June via the [Herts Sports Partnership website](https://sportinherts.org.uk/happy/booking/).
