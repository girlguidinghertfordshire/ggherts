This Spring, School aged children who are eligible and in receipt of benefits related free school meals can enjoy free food, free sports, and free craft activities at over 200 HAPpy Camps across Hertfordshire.

HAPpy is the Hertfordshire activation of the national Holiday Activities and Food Programme. Hertfordshire County Council has joined forces with the Herts Sports Partnership and the Hertfordshire Community Foundation to organise a programme for the school holidays every Easter, Summer and Christmas until 2024.

The HAPpy programme is running free activity camps from 3 April – 14 April 2023 (not bank holidays), and with over 14,000 free activity camp places available, eligible families are being encouraged to get their booking code from their school and reserve a place at a camp near them as soon as possible. (Please note, any codes used for previous delivery phases will not be recognised by the booking system so a new code must be requested from the school office).

 Bookings are now open via the [Herts Sports Partnership website](https://sportinherts.org.uk/happy/booking/), and there are 1000’s of places available!
