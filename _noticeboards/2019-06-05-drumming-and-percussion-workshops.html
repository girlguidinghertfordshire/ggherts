<p class="x_MsoNormal">Drum workshops for Guiding groups and camps.</p>
<p>For more information please download the <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Drum-Fun-for-Everyone.pdf">drum workshop flyer</a></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">All the equipment brought to venue, everyone has an instrument throughout the workshop. Instruments are swapped around so that everyone gets chance to play more than one.  The main aim is always that participants should have fun, and there's always a strong theme of working together.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">For camp work Drum Circle workshops are offered which can be tailored to suit your programme in length. For group visits there are several different workshops, including Drum Circle, to offer:</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>Sammy the Spider - </b>Geared for Rainbow aged children - the story of Sammy, the Spider who has no friends is told through rhythm with a selection of soft toys. The children get to participate, interacting through the journey of discovery as Sammy makes some rather special friends.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>Drum Circle - </b>A Drum Circle is always a unique team working experience: the participants improvise their own rhythms; the facilitator works with this to draw out the best. Together, the group provides a level of musical sophistication which always surprises!</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><b>African Celebration - </b>Children learn techniques and rhythms to accompany a traditional African song. They will also learn a little about the role of the Master Drummer and how rhythm fits into African culture.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The cost varies depending on the number of participants, and the length of workshop.  Normal charging rate is based on £2.50 per child plus a contribution towards travel costs. Special day rates available for any District Camp / Jamboree work.  Prices can be negotiable.  If you are interested to know more contact details are contained in the attached flyer.  Please provide the numbers of children envisaged attending to enable pricing.</p>
