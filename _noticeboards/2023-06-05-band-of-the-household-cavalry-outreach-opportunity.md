The Band of the Household Cavalry is a British Army band based in Windsor. It is the country's largest symphonic wind band and is the only band to play mounted on horseback in the UK.

We are looking to expand our Outreach programme and can offer services such as coming along to units to give presentations about who we are and what we do, including bringing along pieces of uniform to show your young people and teaching them elements of drill and marching.  

Invitations can be extended to units interested in either:

- Watching us perform in a Changing of the Guard ceremony in Windsor Castle, followed by a tour of our stables in Windsor to meet some of the horses,  
- Coming along to attend an open rehearsal held at Norden Farm Centre for the Arts, based in Maidenhead.â€¯
