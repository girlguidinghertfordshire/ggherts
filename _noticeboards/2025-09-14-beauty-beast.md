BEAM Theatre in Hertford is excited to announce that their panto for this year is Beauty and the Beast.

When an arrogant prince is cursed to live as a beast, his only hope of salvation is to find love before the last petal falls from an enchanted rose. Can village girl Belle see beyond appearances and learn to love a beast?
