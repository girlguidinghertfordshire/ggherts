After the driest spring in over 100 years in England, the warmest and sunniest ever in Wales, the 6th driest on record in Scotland, and the warmest ever in Northern Ireland, water scarcity is becoming a growing concern across the UK.

With another dry summer expected and calls for water-saving already being made in some regions, it’s more important than ever to raise awareness about how we use water.

That’s exactly what Come Rain or Shine is all about. As the UK’s independent water efficiency experts, Waterwise is proud to be leading this summer’s national push to encourage sustainable habits, no matter the weather.

The Come Rain or Shine campaign is designed to make water-saving fun, simple, and engaging and includes free, downloadable resources to help children and young people learn about the value of water. There are activities suitable for a range of age groups ideal for use in group settings or at home during the holidays.
