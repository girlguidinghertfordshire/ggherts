Registration for the 2022 subscription of the 200 Club is now open and with all proceeds going towards the upkeep of the Girlguiding Hertfordshire County Centre, Cottered, why not show your support.

A one off payment of £15* gives you the opportunity to join the monthly prize draw, worth £50, along with a super draw in December. This prize pot will be dependant upon how many subscriptions are sold.

For further details, terms and conditions and a registration form, please visit the [Herts Guide Centre website <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>][1]{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} or email <200@girlguidinghertfordshire.org.uk>

<small id="partyear">* Those persons joining throughout the year may pay a part payment for the remaining part of the year in which they join</small>
