Are you free to help make our County Activity Day, taking place on Saturday, 23 April 2022 from 9.30am - 4.30pm, a success for the Rainbows, Brownies and Guides who will be attending?

Volunteers aged 16+ and members of the Trefoil Guild are sought to help with set up and take down, manning bases, running activities, and undertaking administrative duties in the lead up to the event.
