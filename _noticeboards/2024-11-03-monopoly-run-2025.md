Monopoly Run "Live" is back!

**Saturday 1 March 2025** - bookings open in November.

Monopoly Run ‘Live’ is a real-time version of the popular Monopoly Run (London) board game. It is played in a single day in central London and involves visiting the actual sites that the board game is based on. Our bespoke control system allows multiple ‘mini-games’ to be simultaneously run, enabling hundreds of teams to compete on the day, yet each team will only have a maximum of seven other competitor teams, giving everyone a good chance at winning. The game is all about your tactics and speed in getting around the capital!

Enjoyed by many in March 2024. Use a Travelcard to visit as many sites as possible and test your problem solving skills as you go.

Get your team together now.
