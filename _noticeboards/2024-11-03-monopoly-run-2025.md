Monopoly Run "Live" is back!

Bookings are open* with entry at just £8 p.p.

Taking place on **Saturday 1 March 2025** in **London.**

Monopoly Run ‘Live’ is a real-time version of the popular Monopoly Run (London) board game.

It is played in a single day, in central London, and involves visiting the actual sites that the board game is based on. A bespoke control system allows multiple ‘mini-games’ to be simultaneously run, enabling hundreds of teams to compete on the day, yet each team will only have a maximum of seven other competitor teams, giving everyone a good chance at winning.

Previously enjoyed by many Girlguiding and Scout members, players visit as many sites as possible and test their problem solving skills along the way. Tactics and speed in navigating the capital will win the day!

Get your team together now.

\* Bookings close 14 February.
