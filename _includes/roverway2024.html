    <p><img src="/assets/images/2023/03/roverway2024.webp" class="img-fluid float-end m-2">The next joint WAGGGS and WOSM Roverway international trip will take place in Norway in 2024.</p>

    <p>Participants must be aged 16-22 (born between 1 August 2002 and 22 July 2008).</p>

    <p>The event is effectively split into two halves. First, participants "rove" with their "tribe" (a group of
        patrols, all from different countries, numbering about 50 people, in total), on a "pathway" (selected centrally,
        and advised nearer the time), before eventually all coming together centrally, for a jamboree.</p>

    <p>Find out more about the event and application criteria in the FAQs below.</p>

    <p>To be considered for a place, the application form attached must be completed and returned to <a
            href="mailto:international@girlguiding-anglia.org.uk"
            class="alert-link">international@girlguiding-anglia.org.uk</a> by 12 May 2023. Regional selection will then
        take place.</p>
